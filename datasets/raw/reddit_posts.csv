I'm going entirely insane trying to find a real place to find remote work,"I've been applying on indeed and LinkedIn for months with about 20-60 jobs applied for during a week. Only people who got back to me were a few scams and some accidental in person jobs I applied for. For personal health reasons I can only work remote. I can't seem to find ANYTHING better than what I do which is insane when I'm only making 14 an hour. So where can find literally anything better?

Edit: I've got 6 years experience with customer service and sales. I have light coding experience but nowhere near enough to do anything more than entry level for that. I graduated high school and didn't go to college I couldn't afford it.",Sammy_Wants_Death,1722876801.0,290,remotework

Remote work is rarely what you think it is,"I see so many say they‚Äôre looking for entry level remote work that :

* Has flexible hours - show up whenever, work however long you want with breaks whenever and however long you want

* Allows you to travel and work from anywhere in the world

* Can be done while taking care of a newborns or toddlers

* Is easy and pays very well

* Can be done at the same time as another job 

Unless you have a degree and experience, most remote work doesn‚Äôt include any of the above. 

I‚Äôm speaking from both sides of this coin. I was a supervisor with a semi-flexible schedule. I was primary and then sole caregiver for my son as he grew, but I wasn‚Äôt on phones when he was young / in the ‚Äúcould start screaming any second with no advance warning‚Äù stage. I could often start work earlier than scheduled, and then take off early, but not always - if I had a meeting scheduled at the end of my normal shift, I was stuck. If I was working on a proposal of some sort, I could do quite a bit in my head while folding laundry or doing the dishes.  The pay was good, but the stress on my mental and physical health was bigger, and that‚Äôs why I eventually quit. 

Currently in a specialist / customer service roll. Shifts are set and I can‚Äôt start early. Even breaks and lunch are scheduled at specific times. Clocking in late (5 minutes is late) leads to occurrence points which add up to termination. Leaving early accrues the same occurrence points. The metrics you have to meet can be very stressful. You can‚Äôt always get the days off that you want approved. 

Obviously not all remote jobs will fail the bullet points. I‚Äôd love to hear from folks who have alternate experiences to share.",Deedle-Dee-Dee,1693742866.0,174,remotework

Do you get dressed for work when working remote?,"My dad was an early remote worker in the early 2000s...before he had high speed internet or even Zoom.

Every morning, he'd get up, shower, shave, put on a shirt and tie, and head to his office in the spare bedroom. I asked him why he bothered if he was never going to see his boss or clients. He told me it helped him remain professional and keep a solid work/life boundary.

Fast forward to today where I work from my spare bedroom/home office. It's rare that I'm in anything more than shorts or sweats. Some days I have shoes on, but most days I don't. If I have to take a Zoom call, I comb my hair and put on a nice shirt, but everything below the desk is still casual. Some days I never even leave the sofa and do everything from my laptop.

I'm just curious to know where other people fall. Do you ""get ready for work"" or just stumble through the house when it's time to get work done?

The real reason bosses hate remote work.,"After the remote work experiment, many bosses went nuts and shared videos about employees not working at all but playing video games and doing laundry.

The thing is, what actually happen is that remote work showed off the bad planning of the company.  
And most of that bad planning is actually a result of ""office politics"".  
So, by not being in an office, there is no ""politics"", hence, the only thing you can measure is output.  
But, as you can imagine, most of the time we used to spend in the office was playing ""office politics"" and spending time on stupid things to be perceived as ""hardworking"".   
And, once we went remote, employees realize they could finish their assignments is about half of the time.  
So, many went for a second or a third job, which didn¬¥t affect the performance of any, an the proof is most managers never suspect anything about it.   
In a nutshell, what is actually happening is the job market is shifting towards the gig economy and the uberization of gig works.  
And that implies most middle management is useless, as well as the giant real estate most companies own.  
This shit could break drown the whole thing, destroying the system because it would lead to mass white-collar layoffs.   
An that is the thing, corporate America is degrading, the system is being corrupted, so corrupted it is no longer the same anymore, it would be a new system: the sharing economy.",JuggernautBulky1008,1724003526.0,1712,remotework

The hidden cost of hybrid and in-person work: why fully remote is a game changer,"This is going to be a fun read, I promise. üçø

Let‚Äôs talk about what I call the ‚Äútelenovela principle‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a cognitive scientist, and these ideas come purely from observation and experience. But if you‚Äôve ever been caught up in a telenovela or a long-running series, you‚Äôll know the feeling: the intricate power plays, the unspoken hierarchies, the rituals of dominance, and the subtle tensions that keep the drama alive. Even if you step away for a while, the moment you return, you‚Äôre right back in it, and you are *part* of it, immediately recalling the dynamics, decoding glances, and anticipating the next twist.

The office works the same way. When you‚Äôre in person, even part-time, you‚Äôre a participant in this ongoing story. There‚Äôs always a ‚Äúbig monkey‚Äù asserting dominance, the boss who commands unspoken rituals of loyalty, like requiring everyone to laugh at their jokes or adjust their tone in their presence. There are the everyday performers, like the colleague who thrives on adoration or the gatekeeper who silently enforces invisible rules. These aren‚Äôt written in any handbook, but they exist, and they require your mental energy to navigate. You find yourself noticing the power struggles, the alliances forming in hushed conversations, and the subtle gestures signaling favor or disapproval. It‚Äôs an endless stream of social processing, often unrelated to the actual work.

Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt escape this dynamic. Each time you enter the office, it‚Äôs like pressing play on a paused series. You have to catch up on the latest storylines: who‚Äôs climbing the ladder, who‚Äôs fallen out of favor, what new rituals or hierarchies have taken shape. The telenovela is still there, waiting for you, demanding the same mental energy to re-engage with the social mechanics. Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt simplify the drama at all; it just makes it episodic, reinforcing the need to tune back into the plot every time you return.

Fully remote work eliminates this layer of complexity. The drama loses its stage when everyone is behind a screen. Without the proximity to assert dominance or build unspoken hierarchies, the focus shifts to what truly matters: the work itself. While remote collaboration still involves interaction, it‚Äôs more task-oriented and far less emotionally draining. It spares you from the subtle politics, the rituals of adoration, and the constant recalibration that in-person work demands. The absence of this unnecessary ‚Äústory‚Äù frees up your mental space, allowing you to focus on your creativity, productivity, and actual goals. It‚Äôs no wonder that some ‚Äúbig personalities‚Äù resist remote work: it removes the tools they depend on to thrive in this unspoken telenovela. 
Remote work frees us to skip the BS, so to let the big personalities cling to their shenanigans, leaving the drama to the TV.",RevolutionStill4284,1736178369.0,992,remotework

Why Are Companies Abandoning Successful Remote Work Models? A Perspective from a Fully Remote Team,"I've been watching with bewilderment as companies rush to end remote work policies that were working perfectly well. As someone leading a successful remote-first team, I wanted to share our experience and hear your thoughts.

# Our Remote Success Story

We've built a truly global team across San Francisco, Korea, and Japan, achieving something that would have been impossible with traditional office requirements. Here's what's working for us:

# Productivity & Work-Life Balance

* Team members with children can better balance family responsibilities
* No time wasted on commuting
* Flexible hours allow people to work when they're most productive
* Clear boundaries between work and personal life

# Tools & Infrastructure

* Proper remote work tools make collaboration seamless
* Virtual meetings are efficient and well-structured
* Async communication has improved our documentation
* Digital workflows have actually increased transparency

# Global Talent Advantage

* Access to exceptional talent regardless of location
* Diverse perspectives from different time zones
* Ability to serve customers 24/7 naturally
* Significant cost savings on office space

# Common Arguments Against Remote Work (And Why They Don't Hold Up)

# ""People are less productive at home""

In our experience, the opposite is true. With proper tools and processes, our team's productivity has increased. The key is measuring output, not hours at a desk.

# ""We lose company culture""

We've built a strong culture through:

* Regular virtual social events
* Organized in-person meetups
* Clear communication channels
* Strong onboarding processes

# ""Collaboration suffers""

We've found that:

* Written communication improves clarity
* Meetings are more focused
* Documentation is better
* Cross-timezone collaboration brings fresh perspectives

# The Real Question

I suspect the push back to offices isn't about productivity but about control. Many leaders seem more comfortable seeing people at desks than measuring actual output.

But here's what puzzles me: If remote work enables:

* Access to global talent
* Higher employee satisfaction
* Lower operational costs
* Better work-life balance
* Equal or better productivity

Why are companies so eager to give these benefits up?

# Looking for Perspectives

For those in companies pushing return-to-office:

* What's the actual reasoning given?
* Have productivity metrics actually improved after returning?
* How has it affected employee retention?

For remote workers:

* What tools/practices make remote work successful for you?
* How do you maintain work-life balance?
* What challenges have you faced and how did you overcome them?",Bright-Paint-5238,1730779303.0,525,remotework

Remote work for my job was pulled for me last week and now I have to be fully in office.,"So far I have
- Done less work in a week than I did in a day remotely.
- Bled all over myself and everything from four bloody noses in a single datyy horrifying my coworkers and manager 
- Had severe automotive issues occur so I'm going to have to take the rest of the week off for it to be repaired because I live too far to Uber cheaply.
- Not worked a second on one of the few projects that has a deadline for us as it was slated to be a remote only project to feign Ignorance when it blows all up. Had to audit 10 massive different spreadsheets and validate files for them and finished 3 working remotely one day. 
- Spent time getting my resume and cover letter back together to apply for a different position elsewhere. And had it reviewed.

Others kept things murky on purpose, dodging tough conversations until the economy tanked and employees couldn‚Äôt push back as easily. That kind of move screams opportunism to me, not leadership.

The simple reason remote work will win,"Every human system we can think of is built on top of shared beliefs. Where those shared beliefs are deeply questioned by the majority, every system wobbles, shakes, finally dies out.

The office-centric economy is a system. In 2019, very few (including me) were questioning it. It was the way of life we dealt with since the beginning of our careers. Ergo, the system was solidly standing in place.

Then, the pandemic came, and people first started missing office life, to then start questioning office life, more and more.

Now, RTO mandates are being issued, but people aren‚Äôt generally buying in, except for a minority. They‚Äôre questioning the foundations of RTO itself, and a lot. They‚Äôre seeing its flaws. They‚Äôre loathing commutes and cubicles.

It won‚Äôt be apparent immediately, but any RTO initiative is destined to be an intrinsic failure, due to so many people calling BS on it.

It‚Äôs just a question of when, rather than if, offices will die out as the preferred way of conducting business for remote-capable jobs.

There‚Äôs no going back when minds deeply change. Systems need supporters, not detractors and questioners. There aren‚Äôt enough of the first. There are too few believers left.",RevolutionStill4284,1706902355.0,827,remotework

"Walmart Demands Remote Workers Relocate for 'In-Person Culture', Then Asks Arkansas Employees to Work Remotely After Tornadoes Hit","Last month, Walmart announced layoffs and the closure of 51 Health Clinics across the United States. Employees in the Health & Wellness division, initially reassured of their job security, faced another blow just two weeks later:

A majority of Walmart's full-time remote employees received notice this month to relocate to Arkansas or accept severance (if eligible). Concurrently, several hundred other corporate workers across North America received layoff notices without the option to relocate. A smaller number of employees were given the choice to move to remaining offices in the San Francisco Bay, New York, and New Jersey areas. Notably, these offers are based on role and business needs rather than employee proximity to existing offices, resulting in some workers being asked to relocate across the country despite living near a Walmart office. Additionally, if two workers living in the same household receive relocation notices to different offices, the location for the more ""senior"" role will take precedence.

The reason provided for the latest changes? ""Walmart is an in-person culture,"" and they want workers reporting to the office five days a week...(**edit: primarily in Northwest Arkansas**).

This decision came despite the significant contributions of remote workers who helped the company navigate the pandemic, forge new ways of working, and achieve record profits. Walmart's latest financial report, released just days after the second round of layoff and relocation notices, showed profits of over $5 billion.

Ironically, after sending the in-person work mandate, a series of deadly tornadoes struck northwest Arkansas this Memorial Day weekend, causing widespread damage and power outages that affected Walmart's Home Office and many employees in the surrounding areas. In response, Walmart asked its Arkansas employees to work remotely for now...

**---**  
**Edit**: I apologize if my initial post is too nuanced. I appreciate all the perspectives shared here.

The irony I see here is multifaceted. The overall timing of events:

* underscores the need to **support adaptability in working styles**, not criticize and deprioritize them
* sadly exposes the reality of natural disasters overlooked by the fantasy life/culture narrative the company is pushing on workers **(most recently, to a mass workforce across the continent just two weeks ago)**
* shows the hypocrisy of the company's previous **praise of remote work during emergencies**, their **abrupt shift to devalue it**, and their subsequent need to **rely on it again after an emergency**
* emphasizes an ""**in-person culture**"" while a significant portion of their revenue and growth comes from **online sales** that is supported by remote networks
* **promotes digital transformation** to its millions of customers (who also make up their workforce), **but resists it internally**

I feel deeply for those affected by all of these events. Losing your home or loved ones, losing your livelihood, facing relocation demands that prioritize the company after having already uprooted/adapted your life and families to support the company's previous remote work demands...it's all devastating.

In addition, the NW Arkansas employees being expected to navigate difficult conditions after the storms, scrambling to find friends or businesses with working internet and power so they can report to the office remotely is a whole separate concern but still very relevant.

**""Prioritize your work commitments above your individual needs""** seems like the real ""**in-person culture**"" they're pushing here.",circlebacklater,1716968748.0,835,remotework

Contrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby caf√© for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.

**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**

If we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.

If you start by your own you‚Äôll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for ‚Äúguided meditation‚Äù (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.

**Say Thanks, Feel Better**

I've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.

**Write it Out**

Very similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.

**Get a Wise Council**

The most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.

**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**

We're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.

**Read, really read**

You'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book‚Äîany book‚Äîthat piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.

**Cold shower in the morning**

This might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It‚Äôs like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.

**Bed time alarm**

Don't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Set an alarm to remind you to start winding down. Ditch the tech, maybe read something light, and just chill. You're setting the stage for a killer day ahead.

Where are the climate activist when it comes to remote work??,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôve been thinking about how much remote work can impact climate change, and it feels like it should be a bigger part of the conversation among climate activists.

As we all know Remote work can significantly reduce daily commutes, which means fewer cars on the road and less emissions. Studies have shown that working from home can lower carbon footprints by reducing energy use in office buildings and transportation. Yet, I rarely see this pushed as a major climate strategy??

Considering how much attention is placed on cutting emissions in other areas (like transportation and energy production), it‚Äôs surprising that remote work isn‚Äôt being highlighted more. In my opinon climate activist should be on the front line championing remote work and fighting against large corporations and their unnecessary RTO mandates which contribute to the destruction of our planet.

Thoughts? Why aren‚Äôt we seeing more organized efforts promoting remote work as part of climate action? This is definitly a cause I see a lot of people supporting. Would love to hear your opinions!

I feel so much better working remote... Life is wonderful,"I've spent my whole working life feeling a square peg in a round hole.

I'm only 2 days/week in office at my new job and it's great. Usually the days I have to go in are fun and exciting with a variety of non desk based tasks and interactions with some really great colleagues.

I have never gone this long without calling in sick because I simply couldn't bring myself to go in that day. It was always my biggest weakness as an employee and now I am doing just fine. 


The only downside is, I don't think I can ever go back! I can only ever see myself seeking opportunities that allow me to WFH at least 60% of the time.

I feel like I do way more work as a remote worker than I did when I worked in the office.,"What I initially loved about remote work was the option to do household chores throughout the day. After I finished a task, I could do my laundry, I could walk the dog, I could do some cleaning, I could take a shower, you get it. In the office, I worked about the same amount of hours, but in my downtime, I was forced to sit and look busy or shoot the breeze with coworkers instead of actually being productive.

I moved from hybrid to work from home about a month ago. If I am away from my computer for more than two minutes, I am logged off. My boss is tracking how often my computer is logged off and for how long. I have two different productivity trackers installed, that track the amount of time it takes for me to be assigned a task versus viewing the task versus finishing the task. It‚Äôs insane.

Being tracked to this level, actually makes me less productive! I work in short bursts, not in one steady stream. I need a little breaks to work on different types of tasks or talk to people in order to keep my energy up. I‚Äôm not a fucking robot. Again, in the office, I wouldn‚Äôt be penalized for that.

‚ÄúHybrid is an illusion of choice,‚Äù Dean tells Fortune.

"Why Everyone Should Cheer for Remote Work, Even If You Punch In On-Site","Here‚Äôs the deal:

- Traffic‚Äôs a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won‚Äôt feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we‚Äôre not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can‚Äôt work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless.

Working from home is a right. Having people show up to an office to WORK FOR YOU is a privilege.,"There seems to be this idea floating around that being able to work from home is a privilege. That‚Äôs funny because privilege is usually defined by what someone DOESN‚ÄôT have to do or deal with.

If someone‚Äôs entire job is on a computer, they should have the right to work from home. It shouldn‚Äôt be something handed out to the good boys and girls after slaving in an office for a few years. 

Here‚Äôs my reasoning:

People rarely get jobs because they want to work. They often get a job because they have to live like everyone else. They need money to do that and not everyone is entrepreneurial. Fair enough.

As an employer, I don‚Äôt just make up jobs and pull them out of my ass. I decide who to hire based on things I need done that I DO NOT want to do myself and I don‚Äôt already have someone who can do them. These are tasks that need to be completed, some recurring, some not. They are not things that require someone to be in the office everyday for a set amount of time.

I understand that I am privileged to be in this position because many people cannot afford to pay someone else to do things that directly put more money in THEIR pocket or free up some of THEIR time so they can do whatever THEY WANT TO DO.

So to me, the level of ego you must have to think that people who wake up (usually early) 5 days a weeks to fit themselves into YOUR schedule, to maintain YOUR lifestyle, and help YOU achieve YOUR goals is simply too high to calculate.

I personally think it‚Äôs important to be grateful that people don‚Äôt just take your money and leave. It‚Äôs important to be grateful and acknowledge that you are the one in the privileged position. The person who spends all day away from their family, sacrifices time with their kids, and gives up their dreams IS NOT PRIVILEGED!

The least we can do is acknowledge that as employers we ask employees to give up their right to work from where they want when we ask them to come into an office.",Medical-Ad-2706,1701281117.0,455,remotework

Oh how offices have changed,"For those who don't know,  20-30 years ago,  commuting into the office meant:

You had your own desk and chair ( no flexidesking).

You often got your own office.  With a door so you could focus on those important tasks.

You often got a company car for your commute.  At the very least heavily subsidised public transport.

Offices with soundproofing ( they even had ceiling panels).  So no need for headphones.

You even had a carpark allocated so you didn't have to pay for parking.

You were paid enough to buy a home within 30 minutes of where you worked.

Occasional work dinners with taxi fares paid for to get home safely.

So the next time someone who is retired  tells you to suck it up.  Remind them about how companies have turned these work environments into hellholes for many people.

Forced back to Office just to get fired,"Just wanted to share a quick story.

I was working remotely from abroad, and the company suddenly asked all the remote employees to start showing back to the office within a week. 

Now the main issue was that I was the only one working from abroad and I was halfway across the globe. Logistically it was not feasible to just book a flight and come back within a week as flights were super expensive and I had made arrangements for accomodation. On top of that I had a vacation planned in three weeks so going back home and then flying back just didn't make sense.

After some emails back and forth and arguing about it I was told that I had to be in the office by next week or there would be consequences. I complied, went to the office. They set up an HR meeting with me and fired me telling me some BS about how I was pushing it by not following HR policies and started digging up issues from a year ago stating that we are misaligned.

So yeah, I was forced back to the office just to get fired. But hey at least I got 2 months worth of salary as compensation.

RTO thoughts from HR ,"I work in HR and wanted to share some thoughts on remote work, RTO policies, and what the future might hold.

First off, I know HR often gets blamed for enforcing RTO, but trust me, we don‚Äôt want to go back to the office either. The push comes from senior leadership, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs our job to implement it. But we dislike it just as much as everyone else, if not more, because we see firsthand how problematic it can be.

During the pandemic, when everyone was working from home, leadership frequently reminded us that we‚Äôd return to the office once it was safe. However, as the job market shifted in favor of employees, many people started quitting, citing the desire to remain remote during exit interviews. This wasn‚Äôt a small number. Entire teams were dismantled, and filling roles took forever because candidates were clear that remote work was non-negotiable. To combat this attrition and attract talent faster, leadership had no choice but to adjust their stance and embrace remote work as a permanent option.

But by 2024, as the job market turned back in favor of employers, they flipped the script again and announced RTO.

I believe these companies are setting themselves up for a rude awakening when the job market shifts back toward employees. The mass exodus they experienced before, and their struggle to fill positions due to a lack of flexible work options, will leave them with no choice but to adjust their stance again.

In the long run, I don‚Äôt see RTO lasting. Employees have experienced the benefits of remote work, and once the job market shifts again, I expect smart companies will leverage remote work to attract top talent. Meanwhile, those that stick with rigid RTO policies may find themselves falling behind.",Any_Conference550,1737001179.0,1949,remotework

RTO is a f*cking joke,"I don't buy that 5 day RTO will improve collaboration or any performance metrics. In fact I expect productivity to get worse. Here's why:

*Increased commute*

This one is probably the most obvious, but with thr average commute times being around 30 mins, that's an extra hour of your day gone. It's hard to give your best when you're 1) tired from commuting 2) feeling worn down because you have less time in the day to attend to personal life

That's not even considering the extra fuel needed to commute more, putting more financial pressure on employees in an already difficult economy

*Familiarity breeds contempt*

I've worked fully remote, fully in office and hybrid. In my opinion, hybrid is the sweet spot where you continue to manage social relationships with your coworkers which is very useful for productivity. However, seeing/having lunch with your coworkers after a few days a week gets old and annoying. More time spent together also means more chances to get tired of the little annoying things they might do. Like a dripping faucet. Hybrid allowed a nice reset so I felt ready for interaction again

*More hassle*

Prompting everyone to return means more struggle to find parking, more traffic, more accidents (I've seen an unreal amount of them the past couple weeks). 

Meal prepping for the entire week lest you have to eat out and spend unnecessary money. I know this is what they want, but it's frustrating nonetheless


*Less privacy/deep thought*

In office is okay when trying to purely execute on a task from muscle memory but for those who require quiet for deep concentration, it's not the place, especially for an open floorplan office. 

Additionally, coworkers will sometimes interrupt when you're in a flow state which really hurts overall productivity

When I worked fully remotely, I ended up getting promoted off of working 5-6 hour days because I was so much more productive working at home alone. 

*Additional factors*

More likely to get sick. It's winter and everyone is sick. They advise to stay home when sick but I honestly think it'd a badge of honor/dedication in the US to show up even when sick...I don't get it

*Worse for the environment*

It's the in thing for companies to claim they're sustainable or going green these days, but unecessarily forcing people to commute in more often completely opposes that. 

*Meetings are a huge waste of time*

There is this culture of forced delinquency in meetings where you may or may not be needed, but you may sit in a 90 min meeting and only spent 5 mins talking. That time could be used for mindless tasks like packing the dishwasher or folding clothes while still listening and contributing when necessary 

All in all, 5 day RTO seems completely unnecessary for people who can do their jobs remotely and it's infuriating to be micromanaged like this as an adult. As long as my semi annual reviews are good, who cares how often I'm in the office?

RTO is the loudest admission that offices are a complete failure,"RTO mandates are the clearest proof that the office system has failed. If the office worked, companies wouldn‚Äôt need to force anyone back. People would naturally see it as the best place to do their work. Instead, RTO shows that employees don‚Äôt believe in the office as a productive environment. Many see it as a waste of time and personal resources.

Efforts to rebuild ‚Äúoffice culture‚Äù miss the point. The office can‚Äôt deliver what it once did because the world has changed. Everything has shifted in terms of how people think, work, and value their time. The 2019 version of office culture is dead, and the people being called back simply aren‚Äôt the same as before. Trying to recreate the old way is not very different from trying to rebuild a house on a cracked foundation.

Companies that recognize this and adapt will absolutely thrive.

I‚Äôm looking into creating a platform where you could book a few hours to work at someone‚Äôs place instead of sticking to your home office, noisy caf√©s, or crowded coworking spots. Like couchsurfing, but for working.   
The idea is to offer an alternative work environment that feels more personal, comfortable, and flexible‚Äîbasically, a home away from home where you can be productive and maybe meet new people.

I‚Äôd really appreciate your feedback. Specifically:

1. **Would you ever consider using a service like this?** What about it might appeal to you (or turn you off)?
2. **What are your biggest concerns?** (For example, safety, trust, amenities, price, etc.)
3. **How often could you see yourself using this kind of space?**
4. **Would you ever consider hosting other remote workers in your own apartment? Why or why not?**

Feel free to share any extra thoughts or ideas. I‚Äôm in the early stages and your feedback will be super valuable in shaping this concept. Thanks a bunch!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your feedback, I‚Äôve gathered a lot of insightful feedback and I want to thank you! I was able to form a better opinion about the opportunity and will need to go back to the drawing board. That‚Äôs part of the journey. :) ",I_run_this_place,1734513296.0,7,remotework
Excuses to 100% work from home?,"I need some good excuses to work from home fully. 

Background: I work at an accounting firm where working from home is fairly flexible. I am fortunate enough to only have to work 2 days in office. However, I absolutely hate going in. The days I have to go in dictate my entire week. I could explain why I feel this way, but this post would be too long. 

My company does allow for 100% remote accommodations, but only for unique situations. One example I have it a coworker who lives about 3 hours away, is allowed to work from home 100%. 

I like my job and like who I work with, I just absolutely hate working in office. 

Besides moving away‚Ä¶ What are some good excuses I could come up with that would make working from home 100% justifiable?

Do you get dressed for work when working remote?,"My dad was an early remote worker in the early 2000s...before he had high speed internet or even Zoom.

Every morning, he'd get up, shower, shave, put on a shirt and tie, and head to his office in the spare bedroom. I asked him why he bothered if he was never going to see his boss or clients. He told me it helped him remain professional and keep a solid work/life boundary.

Fast forward to today where I work from my spare bedroom/home office. It's rare that I'm in anything more than shorts or sweats. Some days I have shoes on, but most days I don't. If I have to take a Zoom call, I comb my hair and put on a nice shirt, but everything below the desk is still casual. Some days I never even leave the sofa and do everything from my laptop.

I'm just curious to know where other people fall. Do you ""get ready for work"" or just stumble through the house when it's time to get work done?

Just found out company installed software that takes screenshots of open windows and records them every 90 seconds...,"This gives me so much anxiety.

I'm hoping they only use this stuff when they are suspicious but I can't help but get crazy anxiety from this.

Remote job RTO‚Äôd and I‚Äôm all by myself in the office. So much for collaboration. üôÑ,"Rant incoming. 

I work for a large-ish financial firm and was remote from 2020 until this past November. My team was required to RTO 2-3 days per week which I really didn‚Äôt have a problem with because I live so close to the office.

Two of my teammates live in a different state and report into that office with my manager, three are fully remote because they don‚Äôt live within commutable distance to any office, and two would be reporting into my office with me. My first day in office I was told my two local teammates requested/received accommodations to stay remote so I have been by myself in the office since November.

Work from home RTO mandates,"I just landed a remote job in December. I am really loving it so far. 

so far, the RTO mandate for my company only applies if you‚Äôre near an office. So if you live in Kansas City or MA, you have to return to office six days a month. 

The president of the company explained that it was not coming from them. It was coming from corporate. 

He explained why you have to check out a desk every time you come to the office. He said that shows them that you are complying. If you forget to check out a desk, there‚Äôs no way to fix that. He said it‚Äôs really important that you check in every morning. 

I have a little better understanding now of why they are doing it this way. I still think it‚Äôs annoying and dumb and I feel bad for the people that do have to but at least it‚Äôs only six days a month. Just wanted to throw my insight  in there.

Tips for Staying Productive While Working from Home:,"
If you would rather see this in video format, here‚Äôs the YouTube link (otherwise keep reading, it‚Äôs the same points):

Thinking About Working From Home? Watch This First
https://youtu.be/QND4JcLQpa4

‚Ä¢ Set up a dedicated workspace.

Even a small area that's just for work can help you mentally separate your job from the rest of your life.

‚Ä¢ Communicate boundaries with your significant other.

Talk about how your new routine may affect theirs and how to balance shared spaces.

‚Ä¢ Stay focused.

Whether it's coffee, tea, or whatever keeps you sharp, find what works best for you.

‚Ä¢ Move your body.

If you've been sitting for a while, get up and stretch or take a short walk. It's good for your mind and body.

‚Ä¢ Make sure you have enough light.

Natural light is ideal, but if that's not an option, try something like a light therapy device to stay alert and support your circadian rhythm.

Working from home has its perks, but staying productive takes effort. Hope these tips help! Any advice from more seasoned work from home folks is welcome üòä",groovinhard,1737833293.0,0,remotework

How I fixed my constant stiffness when working from home. ,"Hi guys, a bit about me: I'm from London, UK, early 20s (M) and have been working in tech as a software engineer for the last 2.5 years, being 90% remote for most of it. After about a year of not doing much exercise I found myself with very tight hips, legs and neck. I'll be honest, I felt like I was just physically atrophying everywhere and could foresee health issues so I decided to make a change. I've been gradually implementing a new routine for over a year now and its done wonders for my body (and mind), so I thought I'd share it here:

1. Going to the gym - Have been doing a standard push-pull-legs split 3 days a week. Love the gym as it really helps prevent that feeling of everything atrophying (as well as actually getting stronger). 
2. Running - Started running 5-10ks before work 2-3x a week. I actually still don't like long distance running that much but getting the heart pumping and those endorphins has been so good for my mental health.
3. Regular breaks - I take 5-10 minute breaks every hour when I'm working from home just to stand up or do some squats and pushups. This was the first thing I started when I begun changing my routine as it was relatively easy to implement. This is so good for breaking up the day and not being totally still for hours on end, but I did have a habit of skipping breaks. To ensure I didn't, I actually built my own [mac app ](http://www.ocheeflow.com)to block my screen every hour, pretty much forcing me to take a break. You can download it out for yourself, if you're interested or need that extra bit of help like I did.
4. Daily stretching - I stretch for 30minutes every evening, mainly focusing on the legs, hips and glutes. This is so vital even if you don't do much exercise as it allowed me return my body to a 'regular' state after being sedentary for hours. What you'll also find is that you become more liable to injury as well if you start doing tons of exercise as I did as well. 

  
If this is all sounds like a lot, I'd recommend starting with the regular breaks and stretching which shouldn't be too hard to fit into a busier schedule, and you may find like I did that you end up wanting to do a bit more ;) Also, last thing I'd say is to take things slow, don't try implement everything at once, and listen to your body.

Hope you all enjoyed this little post, and would love to hear what people do in their breaks or how you manage your own stiffness.",nilodev-3,1732560583.0,2,remotework

Need a work from home remote job asap,"I am a senior customer service representative (operations agent) who has been dedicated with my local call center Ameridial (now known as Fusion BPO a third party call center) since 2018. With that being said, I now have 6 years of experience with this call center as a customer service representative. 

I still only make $11.50 per hour so i have to work double time in order to even barely make it financially. So i barely have anytime to do anything or even take out time to look for a job. 



I am afraid to call HR because my team lead has been very patient with me and understanding and works with me if i need certain days off. 



When Fusion took over during 2020, they just started new hires at $13 plus. But they apparently forget about the senior reps. I have worked numerous programs (aka clients) over the years but i love customer service retail. However they've had me on RSVP customer service and i HATE IT! I've sounded like a robot now for over 2 years. This isn't the program i applied for however i was put in it because the program/client (a company that sells filters) didn't renew their contract with my employer. I did love that job.



 My team lead said they aren't giving any raises this year. however when i asked a coworker how much they make they said $13 per hour. He said he asked for a raise a while back because of his great work and experience. however he said he's only worked for this company for TWO years but he reached out and asked for a raise but that was probably sometime last year or so since they aren't giving any raises they say. Sorry to rant but i just really really want a different job working from home. Preferably customer service retail because customer service is all ive known since i was a cashier at the age of 16 (34 years ago). Needless to say I know customers.

Im not as concerned about my raise if i can find a way better pay her hour as soon as possible. however until then if someone could tell me how i can speak to HR and tell them without upsetting my team lead that i feel I deserve a raise? I'd greatly appreciate it. I would love a customer service retail job if possible one that will let me have one day off per week because I am my dads power of attorney and sometimes i need one day off during the week to go to appointments or whatnot. I'd be happy with part time if I could just get more per hour because $545 biweekly is a joke. 

About my experience:



Over the years, I have handled inbound and outbound calls for various clients/programs, providing information, support, and solutions. I type 52+ wpm. I have excellent communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. I have consistently achieved high customer satisfaction ratings, low average handle times, and high first-call resolution rates. I am proficient in several popular call center programs including but not limited to Avaya, Intelliscript, Sonic VPN, CRM, script reading efficiency, Zoiper, and VMware, dispoing, and opening and closing the call efficiently without said scripting, including others. When I worked with Filters Fast for almost 2 years, we mostly had to handle issues without scripting. This was the job I loved. We gave order status's placed orders for customers, did damaged or defective claims by forwarding any of those issues to the appropriate person. I am extremely proficient in alpha phonetics. Any help, ideas, or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôd love to hear any advice from people who‚Äôve had success finding something that works for them. Or from others with physical or mobility limitations that have found a fit for them.  I have about 5 years of experience in running and online storefront and physical patreon reward fulfillment but my only reference for that is my ex so :/

Why Are Companies Abandoning Successful Remote Work Models? A Perspective from a Fully Remote Team,"I've been watching with bewilderment as companies rush to end remote work policies that were working perfectly well. As someone leading a successful remote-first team, I wanted to share our experience and hear your thoughts.

# Our Remote Success Story

We've built a truly global team across San Francisco, Korea, and Japan, achieving something that would have been impossible with traditional office requirements. Here's what's working for us:

# Productivity & Work-Life Balance

* Team members with children can better balance family responsibilities
* No time wasted on commuting
* Flexible hours allow people to work when they're most productive
* Clear boundaries between work and personal life

# Tools & Infrastructure

* Proper remote work tools make collaboration seamless
* Virtual meetings are efficient and well-structured
* Async communication has improved our documentation
* Digital workflows have actually increased transparency

# Global Talent Advantage

* Access to exceptional talent regardless of location
* Diverse perspectives from different time zones
* Ability to serve customers 24/7 naturally
* Significant cost savings on office space

# Common Arguments Against Remote Work (And Why They Don't Hold Up)

# ""People are less productive at home""

In our experience, the opposite is true. With proper tools and processes, our team's productivity has increased. The key is measuring output, not hours at a desk.

# ""We lose company culture""

We've built a strong culture through:

* Regular virtual social events
* Organized in-person meetups
* Clear communication channels
* Strong onboarding processes

# ""Collaboration suffers""

We've found that:

* Written communication improves clarity
* Meetings are more focused
* Documentation is better
* Cross-timezone collaboration brings fresh perspectives

# The Real Question

I suspect the push back to offices isn't about productivity but about control. Many leaders seem more comfortable seeing people at desks than measuring actual output.

But here's what puzzles me: If remote work enables:

* Access to global talent
* Higher employee satisfaction
* Lower operational costs
* Better work-life balance
* Equal or better productivity

Why are companies so eager to give these benefits up?

# Looking for Perspectives

For those in companies pushing return-to-office:

* What's the actual reasoning given?
* Have productivity metrics actually improved after returning?
* How has it affected employee retention?

For remote workers:

* What tools/practices make remote work successful for you?
* How do you maintain work-life balance?
* What challenges have you faced and how did you overcome them?",Bright-Paint-5238,1730779303.0,522,remotework
LinkedIn Gave me a Remote Job - $37/hr. Work from Home.,"Hey Guys,

I am from N Carolina and I have been recently struggling to get a job after an recent event of accident. Surfing the internet, desperately look for an income source I have stumbled upon a LinkedIn post - well actually a newsletter where they actively send emails about new remote jobs.  
  
It was mind-blowing to know that there are actually so many opportunity. I have been in this group for a while now and maybe somebody out there may get help from this email newsletter.

"After 4 years of fully remote, I am going back to office ","It will be hybrid but I may just go in everyday for the next couple of months since the heat is better there lol, and I live close enough I can practically walk to work - this job allows remote and hybrid (everybody in office 3 days a week is considered hybrid , nobody is in office everyday )

No I don‚Äôt miss any office chitchat - in fact I won‚Äôt really see anyone for the most part since they are either hybrid or remote , so the chance of us running into each other more than once a week is probably low 

I just want a different work space that‚Äôs not my home, or when I get really tired at home I can have a change of scenery and continue working 

I live alone with no kids/pets so I don‚Äôt really get much benefit out of working from home 

I enjoyed it at first when everybody was forced to work remote in 2020, but the novelty has worn off for me. I don‚Äôt miss going to work everyday , so hybrid works best for me, especially when I still wont see any person in person for the most part lol

Update: thanks for all the support and understanding, and to all the haters and projectors: I don‚Äôt hate remote , I really don‚Äôt , and I may go back to remote at some point, but right now hybrid is what works best for me, why can‚Äôt we just have our free will to choose without being crapped on by you just because the choice is different from yours ? It‚Äôs like pineapple on pizza , if I don‚Äôt like it I just won‚Äôt buy/eat it, but I won‚Äôt talk crap about people who try to enjoy it ",PaynIanDias,1735664302.0,477,remotework

Work from home as a disabled with no experience. ,"I recently had some of my disability payments cut because I moved in with my partner and due to financial reasons I no longer qualify for the benefits I was receiving.

I had already been occasionally applying to WFH jobs with no luck but with the payments being cut I'm taking it very serious and applying to new jobs everyday. 
The problem is I have never worked in a job before and have 0 work experience. Almost all of the jobs online are looking for people with experience and I simply don't cut it. I'm open to doing online courses to expand my knowledge on certain jobs but is there anything I can do other than online courses to help myself? 

It's damn near impossible for me to get a job in the real world due to chronic illnesses. I have considered volunteering with mental health groups to get phone experience. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know my chances of getting a remote job with no experience is pretty slim but I don't know what else to do.",BluehairedHobbit,1725485610.0,0,remotework

Request to Relocate Denied,"Hello, I‚Äôve been working for a company my entire adult life, for the last 17/18 years in the same roll which I kind of don‚Äôt hate. For 15 years I‚Äôve been fully remote. Last year they decided on this ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù work where we‚Äôre now expected to go in the office once a week or 3 times a month if we‚Äôre within 50 miles of an office. I live right on the border so I stayed fully remote. Now I‚Äôd like to relocate to be near our aging and recently widowed grandmother and where I can afford a home for my family (California market is out of control) but they denied my request (after approvals from 4 levels above me). People in my department have always been allowed to moved before to places without an office nearby and are not expected to go to an office. But suddenly they‚Äôve decided we‚Äôre not allowed to do that. How is it ok for them for force us into an office after 15 years and start suddenly denying requests to relocate? All in the name of going into an office with no associates I actually work with. I‚Äôve never even met most of my team in all these years because they refuse to pay to get us together. I just don‚Äôt understand and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Staying is not an option because inflation has made California impossible and I do not have family anywhere less than 4 hours from an office.",Independent_Target44,1720017167.0,456,remotework

Anyway, I have been fighting social security for some time now, and I have a family to take care of, so I genuinely have no experience for online type jobs, always worked the farm or did land surveying, so I know a bit of AutoCAD due to surveying for a while. 
Other than that, no experience at all with online work(always worked with my hands)

So I have read around I have the general idea how online jobs work, I've done the reading about it and understand most ask for degrees and stuff. 

Any information to work towards something would be fantastic, thank you in advance.

Currently, 12.7% of full-time employees work from home, illustrating the rapid normalization of remote work environments. Simultaneously, 28.2% of employees have adapted to a hybrid work model. This model combines home and in-office working, offering flexibility and maintaining a physical presence at the workplace .

Despite the steady rise in remote work, most of the workforce (59.1%) still works in the office. This percentage underscores that while remote work is on the upswing, traditional in-office work is far from obsolete. 

By 2025, 60 to 90 million Indians will work remotely by 2025
Looking ahead, the future of remote work seems promising. According to CXOToday, by 2025, an estimated 60 to 90 million Indians will be working remotely, which equates to approximately 10.12% to 15.17% of the Indian workforce, when India‚Äôs labor force is 593 million, according to World Bank Data. This projection suggests a continuous, yet gradual, shift towards remote work arrangements.

98% of workers want to work remotely at least some of the time. 
Interestingly, workers‚Äô preference for remote work aligns with this trend. A staggering 98% of workers expressed the desire to work remotely, at least part of the time.

Mark my words: a WFH wave will come to the US. It'll be BIG.,"No matter what reasons the CEOs have for mandating RTO, remote work will win the war.

As office space leases come up for renewal, many will simply expire and those expiring tenants will move to WFH. Maybe companies that own their office space will also see a cost savings, sell the office(s), and transition to WFH.

Not only that, but the tide is turning in the employee's favor with the Fed starting to decrease interest rates.

All this means more remote jobs opening up, and as they do, the office mandate companies will go to full-time WFH or else find themselves running on a skeleton crew, or worse. Like, a tech company with an office mandate could find themselves with no tech workers.

It'll be one bigass wave.

"If your employer is ending WFH, they are probably gearing up for passive layoffs. Here is why.","Profit is the driving force of rapacious corporations ‚Äî not CEO happiness, appeasing mid-management, or the need for more face time. Those are excuses organizations give as *employee-facing propaganda*.  It‚Äôs more of the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre family‚Äù crap.

You never hear a company attributing layoffs as a means for improving shareholder returns, it‚Äôs always some bullshit excuse rather than ‚Äúwe outsourced our customer service to India.‚Äù

Therefore, the reasons they give are the most plausible they can think up that hopefully the employees will swallow. It is never the truth. Stop expecting them to be honest.

The statistics are out there.  By every measurable metric, remote jobs save the company money, increase productivity, make for happy employees, and save the environment. 

So why would a business jeopardize all that to bring unwilling workers back to the office? Trust me, the C-suite doesn‚Äôt give a shit about what the managers want, either. This isn‚Äôt a misguided decision. They don‚Äôt care about you enough to punish you. 

Return to office is a calculated move and the results are exactly what it intended. Putting butts in chairs is not the goal. Getting you together in the same room with your boss isn‚Äôt the issue. And it is not about investment portfolios.

It has always been about numbers.

**Employers use return-to-office as a means of passive layoffs, to reduce staff without the negative PR, severance costs, or hassle.** 

They can then overwork their staff by claiming they can‚Äôt find enough qualified candidates within commuting distance. They can run dozens of ads to absolve themselves of any responsibility.

WFH is being used as a staffing tool. Need more workers but don‚Äôt want to increase payroll? Offer WFH. Need to let 20% of your staff go? Use return to office as a means of attrition.

Best WFH City?,"WFH blew up 4 years ago, what is a good resource for best WFH cities? Has there been a consensus yet?

What I see is that no city is perfect, but there are perfect cities for the right person. 

For people who've already lived in multiple cities, where did you like most and why? 



Background: I left NYC to move to Scottsdale, not sure I'll renew my lease and looking into other cities.

I've researched this and I don't like generic blog posts, because they appeal to everyone, rankings are different for different people, ages, demographics and interests. Would be great if there was a dynamic data set that ranked cities on what you like and you could slide filters to change your rankings, does that exist?



My background and what is important to me: 

I'm a 33 year old single male no kids, I left NYC because of cost of living, weather, taxes, crime, and tired of being in a small space.

I like Scottsdale but some cons: COL has skyrocketed since 2020, running out of things to do after 4 years, looking for variety, new adventures, and dating here's not the best



Important factors in a new city are weather, low taxes / COL, high quality of life, good dating environment (for straight men specifically), nature and outdoor activities. STRONG internet

I don't ski so CO is probably out.

Options that rank highly online that I've considered but haven't spent much visiting: 

TX has good weather / COL

Charlotte and other Carolina suburbs 

Tampa Bay 

Oklahoma very low COL (bad weather)

Atlanta suburbs like Savannah 

Puerto Rico or Costa Rica

What are other good cities? For people who have relocated to TX, Carolina's, Tampa Bay etc, how is it going there? Pro's and Con's?

Besides the obvious answer of ""Corporate America with these real estate companies wanting to lease out space in office buildings..."" my answer is more along the lines of, the people who look at remote/WFH as an opportunity to do more personal things than work related stuff and don't get the work done. I don't mean the people who need to step away 20-30 minutes in the morning/afternoon to drop off/pick up their kid or take care of a medical issue or anything like that. Who I mean are the folks that make weird excuses like ""My grandmother's uncle's cat is sick and I need to take it to the vet because nobody else is already"" and then disappear all day, doing no work at all and often falling behind on what they should be doing at work.

Opinion: Spouses/Family one of the biggest WFH challenges.,"Not sure how often this gets brought up, but I wanted to share a real take for anyone considering remote work, especially those with families. TL;DR 

I've been working remotely for 2.5 years, and one of the biggest challenges I‚Äôve faced is learning how to navigate deeper dynamics with my partner and kids. 

Traditional work takes you away from home 5 days a week, 40+ hours. Before transitioning into my current role, I‚Äôd often stay late or work 6 days a week, leaving home at 7 and returning between 5 or 6. Remote work has completely flipped that.

At first, it was amazing. My wife is a homemaker and a damn good one, and I started to witness firsthand just how much effort goes into raising two kids. I also got to see my kids grow, hitting milestones I might have missed otherwise. It‚Äôs been life changing. I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything, and I know I‚Äôm a much different dad because of it.

But here‚Äôs the struggle:
Being around your partner and kids 24/7 brings out new dynamics you might not expect. You see different sides of each other, and emotions shift. Conversations can take on a different tone or edge. The love deepens, but so can resentment.

Why resentment? It‚Äôs the tension of being there but not really there. I can‚Äôt always step away to help with a tantrum, change a diaper, or prepare snacks and meals. My wife acknowledges this but has admitted that it‚Äôs hard for her to not feel jealous when I am physically present but unavailable to help. And that can create friction.

As a partner, you want to support them. As a parent, it‚Äôs heartbreaking to tell your kids you can‚Äôt play because you‚Äôre working or in a meeting, especially as they get older and start trying to make sense of this world. It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows. Some of the hardest days come from the emotions you have to face with your family.

We‚Äôve had arguments about everything from a lack of respect for my work to her feeling unappreciated as a homemaker. Communication has been key, and we‚Äôve learned how important it is to carve out time not just together but also alone. 

One challenge I‚Äôm still figuring out is the lack of a ‚Äúdecompression‚Äù period that traditional work gives you, there‚Äôs no commute to mentally transition from work mode to home mode when you‚Äôre remote. And there‚Äôs an interesting psychological aspect to this: when you work outside the home, you miss your partner and kids. That distance creates a longing, and when you come back, you can often bring your best self: excited, refreshed, and happy to reconnect.

But when you‚Äôre home all day, that longing isn‚Äôt there in the same way. I don‚Äôt miss them as much because I‚Äôm always there. And they don‚Äôt always get ‚Äúhappy dad‚Äù either, because I‚Äôm constantly exposed to the hard parts of the day...the tantrums, the moments when my wife is frustrated, and everything else that comes with the chaos of a young family... It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm part of the chaos without being able to do much about it, and that lack of separation can make me feel extra drained or annoyed, even though I‚Äôm not the one actively dealing with it. There‚Äôs no blissful ignorance when you‚Äôre home all the time; you hear it all, and it can take a toll on your energy and mood.

So, for anyone considering remote work, I think it‚Äôs important to go in with open eyes. There are huge positives, but also real challenges, especially if you have a stay at home partner and kids. It‚Äôs not just about having a home office or time flexibility, it‚Äôs about how those dynamics shift when you‚Äôre home all day, every day.

If you‚Äôve got advice or ideas, I‚Äôd love to hear them. We‚Äôre still navigating this journey two years in. Remote work can be incredible, but like anything, it‚Äôs got its highs and lows.",manamongstcorn,1732504160.0,182,remotework

Thought you might like to rage at this email. Wednesdays are no longer an option for one of our two allowed WFH days.,">**Colleagues ‚Äì**

>One of our core values is that AOS will be a great place to work and one of the many things that makes AOS a great place to work is the strong relationships we build with our co-workers. As such, our preference as an organization is to have our employees working together in our offices as much as possible.

>Recently, we conducted a survey to measure the impact our remote work program had on our ability to collaborate, communicate and ultimately build those strong relationships. I am pleased to report that the feedback around remote work continues to be very positive overall. There were a couple key insights identified by the survey:

>Collaboration, communication, and positive energy come from getting people together face-to-face. While many departments have established specific on-site days to fit the needs of their group, there would be a greater positive impact if we extended this practice across all business units, functional groups, and teams.¬†¬†

>Technology enables us to have a ‚Äúvirtual first‚Äù tendency. Even when employees are on-site and in-person collaboration and meetings are possible, there appears to be a default to using Zoom or Teams.¬†

>Considering these insights and the desire to maintain a work environment that is high energy and collaborative, we are making a small adjustment to the AOS remote work program\*\*. As of Wednesday, September 4, 2024, we are implementing ‚ÄúCollaboration Wednesday‚Äù across all US sites.\*\*

>On or before September 4, employees should adjust their remote work schedule to ensure everyone is in the office on Wednesdays. We are asking employees to focus on in-person collaboration during this on-site day. Examples of this include one-on-one sessions or team meetings between employees who work in the same office. In order to make ‚ÄúCollaboration Wednesday‚Äù effective, we ask that you review your calendar and try to limit the number of Zoom meetings you participate in on Wednesdays.

>We also wanted to take this opportunity to clarify questions that are asked frequently regarding the Remote Work Program:

>Two remote days per week is the maximum; however, some jobs may only be eligible for one day per week.

>It is up to the employee and their supervisor to determine which one or two days they will work remote (except for Wednesday). The arrangements can be altered by the supervisor at any time due to a change requested by the employee, a change in business needs or performance concerns.

>The nature of work may require employees to be on-site on their scheduled remote day(s). Examples include on-site meetings during a scheduled remote day, customer visits, team-building events, etc. In the event that an employee does not work their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù remote days(s) one week, those days do not carry over, and they are not entitled to additional remote days.

>Collaboration Wednesday is not intended to limit necessary business travel.

>We appreciate everyone making these small adjustments and are excited to experience the benefits. If you have any questions, please contact your local Human Resources Representative.

>Thanks,

I almost exclusively work with others in the company in locations other than my own. I am in Haltom City, TX. I don't have any reason to talk to anyone at my location ( other than my boss) lately. I mainly work with others in Austin, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Tennessee.

But, there was someone else who had their technical interview that day, and he was slightly better at the coding test they gave and had experience that more closely aligned with theirs, banking vs my data engineering for a retail company.

"Still mourning loss of WFH ""privilege"" 2 months later","Hi all :)

I really loved the opportunity to work from home. I was just as productive as I am in the office, I had all the resources I needed, and I was able to maintain a healthier work-life balance. My commute costs were cut down, too, of course. And even though this was scheduled one day a week, I could go home after half a day in person and WFH if I wanted, or WFH on recovering-from-being-sick days, which was sublime!

Regrettably some assholes in our department decided to do nothing (generate no productivity) on their WFH days. Now we've lost staffing because people realize they're doing the jobs of 6 other people and management is tightening restrictions. They've even disabled the ability for us to clock in and out at our workstations...

I only get 12 hours a month of PTO - which is a bank used for sick time AND personal time. If COVID surges up in the office again that means I have to use that rather than going home and protecting myself and my family. If I have an emergency for which I have to go out of state, I have to use PTO.

I love my job... I don't love the loss in flexibility. But I can't leave because I do intake for a really vulnerable patient population. (Or at least, that's why I feel I can't leave.)

I don't have any specific questions... I just wanted to vent and see if anyone can relate.

Sitting on a chair for a long time can break your back. This is the body part that gets the most abuse when you are working in front of your desk.

¬†While we have chosen chairs that can provide maximum comfort and support for the back,¬† we have also considered other features such as the ergonomics of the arms, the breathability of the material, and seat comfort.

You can find an array of supportive chairs on our list. These can help you get the day‚Äôs job without having to compromise your health and comfort.¬†",Julia_Minaa,1732816807.0,76,remotework

A lot of WFH free time any feedback is appreciated.,"I am a remote Analyst for a Bank. I graduated a year ago and have been with the Bank as an intern for a few years while completing my undergrad. I only work like 2 hours a day maximum and have been feeling really guilty with how much free time I have. My manager has only ever complimented me during reviews, and I get all my work done in a timely manner. I am fearful that I will somehow get fired or laid off because management will realize how much time I have.

EDIT: My job does require reporting skills that would take someone longer as I am familiar with our systems and processes. I am busier toward quarter end as I generate most of our reporting for leadership. Also generate ad hoc reports that come in randomly for audits and such.

My problem is that I do not know how to fill my free time to feel less guilty/fearful. I have completed corporate learning courses, two certifications, and am starting my master's degree in April to hopefully advance within the Company (I really like working with the people here).

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the feeling of guilt or ideas to help with this situation?

Really appreciate any feedback.",Basic_Conflict_2052,1706544682.0,138,remotework
Depressed WFH - how to be social again?,"I've been WFH fully remote for 2 years now, 26M and I have become a complete hermit. I work from home, game in my free time, eat, sleep, and that's about it.

Giving up WFH for 30k,I have a fairly comfortable wfh SWE job that is low pay for where I live I am at a base pay of 100k roughly (there are bonuses in 2023 I got 112k total but 2024 was just 102k total comp) and have a job title of Software Engineer 2 and was just offered a fully onsite role with a considerably higher pay 131k and a job title of Principal Software Engineer but it would be fully in the office and would need to fly to Oklahoma from Socal every 6 weeks and stay there for about a week at a time. There's some rumors that with the Trump/Musk push to return to the office there might be a push for some hybrid work at my current employer so I'm not sure if I should just bite the bullet now and go for the higher pay now and cash in on the title and deal with the travel and in office. My gut tells me to stay with what I know and try to find a higher paying job that's private sector and remote or hybrid but I've been with my current employer for about 3 and a half years and there's not a ton of recruiters hitting me up these days.

Looking for WFH that doesn't use Phone calls,"I'm 29M with a 1 year old little girl who stays with me all the time. She's gotten really bad separation anxiety and doesn't like to be left alone so you could say she's attached at the hip.

I'm also a full time student studying to get my BS in Software Engineering, currently in my 2nd term. I'm a Veteran so I get help with rent because of it (BAH), but it's not enough to pay the bills. My wife works as a restaurant server and maybe makes between 30$-60$ a day which isn't enough even still. I don't want to tell her to go get a better job because I look plain dumb saying that and I know it.

Got the ole bait and switch being told I could WFH during interview,"I was working a fully remote position last year and applied for a new company for a nice salary bump. 

Had 4 rounds of interviews and was told I could start with 2 WFH days and apply for full remote after 6 months.

Accepted position, made the mistake of not getting the remote work verified in my contract. 

First day of work I ask about WFH and they complete 180 and say I have to start fully in the office and wait 6 months to get the 2 days. 

My 6 month mark hits and then they say I have to be employed for 1 full year and I‚Äôll get 1 WFH day and then get a 2nd WFH day after 2 years. Also those days are contingent on exceeding set metrics. Complete and utter bullshit. And the really funny thing about this is that every employee hired before me still has their 2-5 WFH days and the new policy started only for new employees who start the month I was hired.

"Have you had ""real"" work experience before starting your WFH job?","Have you had ""real"" and ""in person"" work experience in an office before WFH?

I'll explain, but before that, a few facts about me: 

I have been looking for a job for a while now, almost 6 months now. I recently graduated in Languages and communications, and the jobs I applied to have been the most diverse, from the lowest positions to the highest, but all of them with the common factor, that is, Languages. An example would be language specialists for AI, other would be managers with knowledge of X amount of languages, and lately simply ""translator in X language"" but I wasn't able to find anything. 

Like I said, I have just graduated, but if the requirements that some jobs posted are what you'll be actually doing on the job, then I am more than qualified to do them, and sometimes I'm extremely under qualified. 

The fact is that I can't seem to land an interview. In 6 months I've sent over a hundred CV's but only 4 times I've had someone interview me, and that was back in June for jobs like hotel receptionist for a month or cold calls. That's not what I want to do, pinballing between seasonal work. 

I've been told that it's because I have no work experience, and before having a remote job I need to have some ""real"" and ""in person"" work experience (which btw I have plenty of time of). I really don't know what to do, I'm just throwing CV's out, hoping that some will stick.

Job won‚Äôt let me wfh 2 days a week,"Everyone in my office gets at least 1 day a week wfh as part time staff. I am full time staff and am only allowed one day.

I was recently off work with stress due to my very long commute ( 4 hour). They basically did nothing to support me- they said they gave me 1 day already.

They say I'm there to be cover however not 1 thing has ever happened for me on this particular day which has required me to be there in person.

It's particularly annoying becuase one member is part time, works two days from home and only comes into the office one afternoon per week, and she lives 10 minutes away!

I am more productive at home.

Anyone else have Chronic Pain that started after they began WFH? My doctors are mostly telling me to go to the gym more and I feel like I'm being a hypocondriac," I am mostly posting to see how common this is and whether I need to be more persistent with doctors because I feel like I'm gaslighting myself. So please tell me about your own experiences if you have the time. I will list out the specificities of the pain and my equipment below; I apologize in advance for the length

I started working from home 3 years ago almost full-time and started experiencing severe neck pain about two months in. 

# Equipment:

*  Vertical and horizontal monitor,    
*  Footrest (chair is too tall)    
*  Herman Miller office chair    
*  Standing desk (used irregularly at the moment, I typically don't use it now because of the chronic pain from my knees)    
*  A walking pad under a standing desk
*  Many, many different types of pillows (buckwheat, memory foam, medcline, body pillows, etc)

I also walk at least one mile a day, but I used to not until early this year. However, when I didn't walk a mile daily, I tried to go to the gym for at least 30 minutes - 1 hour for 2-4x/week. I have never been in bad shape and currently weigh about 125lbs at 5'2.5 ft. And I am mid-twenties, so it's not an age thing. S



# The history of chronic pain ->

\- TMJ issues after a wisdom tooth removal. It was so bad at one point that I couldn't open my jaw more than 26mm for 2 years. I had migraines 3x/week immediately after I got out of work, chewing hurt horribly, couldn't eat most foods, and it exacerbated my neck pain. I had surgery this February to correct it, but my joint relapsed, leading to the pt and splint. Luckily, this worked, because I was scheduled to have the joint completely replaced this December. I was told I have stage 4 out of 5 osteoarthritis (or Chondromalacia?) in the joint and that I had no choice but to get a TJR if the arthroscopy didn't work. This wasn't caused by WFH, but all of my problems are mostly joint-related which is why I mention it. The only reason I have healed is bc I had a phenomenal PT. The way my specialist put it was that my jaw is hypermobile, and typically hurt joints are in a cast. So once I strengthened the muscles and got a splint, I started recovering quickly. 



\- Neck pain. This was the first thing caused by my lifestyle change after I started my job. I have had some form of neck pain for 3 years now. It's always there, at different levels of pain. I do daily PT and see my physical therapist 1-2x/week for this for 8 months now, use the right pillows, etc, but I haven't found anything that helps. My most recent PT said my shoulder blade muscles are so weak that my trapezius and scalene muscles are being forced to work more, causing them to spasm and be in pain. I've also had steroid injections, am currently taking a trial of a week of oral steroids, wear a back brace occasionally, and have had my neck xrays with nothing abnormal showing up for the discs. If I sleep with a bad pillow or do something to irritate it, I can be in pain for up to a week, which includes limited movement of my neck, and moderate pain to the point it gives me migraines.



\- Knee pain. This started this February and is the main reason I am so unsure of whether this is just caused by my lifestyle.   
I have had three separate instances of my right leg giving out when walking, out of nowhere. This corrected itself within a few hours each time. I have had instances where walking or standing in place for too long causes my legs to throb all night to the point I can't sleep. At the moment, I've been told I have floating kneecaps and I have a knee brace to wear. However, I can't walk or stand in one place for too long without pain. My boyfriend and I have been walking outside for at least 1 mile a day for 8 months now, along with my pt. It's helping, but yesterday I injured myself at the gym while running on the treadmill, and it was painful to walk until the next day. It's also painful to walk downstairs, especially when I'm hurting, and standing is worse than walking. I have also had times when my legs would start tingling painfully during work, but I haven't had that happen for a while. 



\- Joints pop everywhere. My knees pop at least 100 times a day, my hips pop every time I sit cross-legged, my shoulders pop when I reach for something, my neck pops when I stretch, and my TMJ would pop in the beginning of its degradation. I was very scared I had some form of arthritis but blood tests have ruled that out. I had one instance where I lowered my leg while it was propped on my desk, heard a loud pop, and was then in an extreme amount of pain.



\- Not joint related, but vaso-vagal syncope, tachycardia, and gastro issues. I think the fainting is mostly from stress, bc I can't handle needles anymore and have had extreme stomach pain that has caused me to faint twice in the last year. The tachycardia is sinus tachycardia, with no irregular rhythm; my heart rate is just typically between 90-120bpm while sedentary. I have had scares while trying a new medication where my sedentary bpm would be 135-145, but after situational and med changes, that has subsided.





I just want to know whether this is normal for my activity level and background. What drives me crazy is my sister, my boyfriend, and my other friends do less activity than me and have no pain at all, while working at less-than-ideal setups. I also go out almost every weekend and plan trips that often have much walking. I've been to San Diego, DC, Charlotte, and Japan in the last year, just as an example. My knee pain was so painful on my last two trips that I had to use a wheelchair at a theme park we went to, or I would not have been able to walk without limping. I have had no injuries to any of my joints, aside from the TMJ.  
  
My previous PCP told me it was caused by my job and that there was no point in any diagnosis since it's caused by my job and I was not going to quit. I still walk around my house all day, do chores, cook, and do everything I would aside from going into an office. But surely this is not normal, right? I have a couple of good doctors that are helping me but I really don't want to waste their time if this is my fault. 

***TL;DR: TMJ issues, knee issues, neck pain, joints pop, after starting WFH position 3 years ago. Various treatments have not helped, including PT, steroid injections, ergonomic equipment, etc. Is this normal?***



Thank you for reading this long. I'm really looking for other experiences from remote workers if only to assure myself I'm not crazy and need to keep seeing my specialist to get to the bottom of it. I don't have debilitating pain every single day, so it's sometimes easy to forget until I wake up or trigger something in my body. But if it is common, I would like to hear that too. I know that my lifestyle definitely plays a part in this, and it is important to keep up with exercise and moving your body. I just want to know whether I should keep looking into whether this could also be exacerbated by an autoimmune issue, etc. 



I've included data from my Apple watch to show that I am actively trying to strengthen my muscles. I just got back from Japan Nov 15th, so from the 3rd until then, it's not super accurate to my day-to-day. But my weekly average steps tend to be over 4500. I was told by my doctor though that I need at least 10000/day üò≠

Dell just enforced 100%RTO and I'm remote and feel I will be laid off. What do I do?,"Hello, I have worked for Dell for 6 years. Before Covid, we always had 2 days a week WFH, but they are getting rid of even that. Now it's 5 days mandatory, which is really shocking. I expected Dell to go to pre covid policies atleast. 

Anyways, I'm a remote employee, I gave up the ability to get a promotion or raise to stsy remote but unfortunately the cost of living is superseeding my once more than plentiful paycheck. And I feel that Dell will be laying me off because I am remote. 

I enjoy working remote, it's better for my focus and I always got more done because I don't have distractions at home. I want to continue remote work but I'm not sure where to go if Dell lays me off. Where have others gone after Dell that has worked for them with better pay and Remote policies?

I work a sales role with some low level OT help desk knowledge.  I have a side business after hours detailing jets but I'm curious what other options are out there.

WFH debate... another perspective ,"This has been on my mind for such a long time & need to vent. Before I rant though, having a WFH job would be a dream & I would travel all the time. But, here's another thing I feel no one is talking about.

I feel this whole WFH debate is changing, especially because we are not in a pandemic anymore. 

I work for a tech company. I have a position where I need to go to the office every day, 5 days per week. Commuting is time & money. For myself, I drive to my job 45 min. to an hour one way. When you do the math, it's about 10 hours per week I'm commuting.

Just like so many companies & mine... our leadership team is telling everyone to go the office. Some do, some don't. There have been so many times where I go to the office & I'm the only one there. It's actually pretty weird. Here I am, by myself. Many times in an office building where the rent is 10k per month. As I said in the beginning, I would love to WFH. But I go to the office every day, because having a job is important & don't want to get fired.

With that being said, I take care of attendance. I can see who's coming to the office & who isn't. Employees still don't listen, even when it's the CEO of the company telling people that you need to go to the office. I learned over the couple years, that so many people are so entitled, thinking the rules don't apply to them. It's actually sad.",lifeisamystery87,1735539925.0,0,remotework

Requested to appear in-person. Can I just stay WFH?,"I work for a call center. My supervisor told me that if I didn't meet the company's 95% quality control metric, I would be asked to work in person. I understand that the company policy leaves this to my supervisor's decision and not the company's. Her reasoning is that I seem distracted while at work. 

I signed up for this job in the first place because I don't have my own driver's license, and I can't always rely on others to drive me over for the weekdays. I already communicated this with my supervisor, and she compromised by giving me a month to pass 95% quality control. (When I first started almost a year ago, it was 90%, but it gradually went up. I haven't been able to pass for months since.) While I appreciate that she was willing to give me leeway, the most I could manage was to improve. My last average score ended up being close to passing, like 94.7%, which feels like a slap in the face.

I'm pretty sure I know the answer already, but I really do want to figure out a way to keep my job. I don't want to end up having to stop working because of this.

HP laptop is not cutting it.

Seemed like a decent option. But it's not cutting it. I don't need to do a LOT, but I do need a lot of tabs open (10-20), sometimes a program or two (Word/Xcel), and take meetings. This laptop apparently can't handle that, and I'll have one meeting running and my windows and tabs and it tell me my laptop is ""under a heavy load"" and bogs down to the point it's freezing up on me. I've tried all the troubleshooting I can find, and got my husband's input too, because he's the tech guy in the house.

BADLY NEED OF WFH JOB,"Hi!

I am a civil engineer in the Philippines and currently looking for WFH jobs that align with my profession. I am currently employed in a known company and been with them for nearly 2 years already. The past weeks have been very stressful for me and I always find myself crying before and after work. The company is currently cost-cutting and it has been affecting the work culture A LOT. My workmates are nice. But due to cost-cutting, a lot of my workmates have been laid off. In the end, those who have stayed need to do a 2-3 person job. I have no emergency fund and savings as of the moment and resigning wouldn't be a great choice. This has been taking a toll on my mental health. I am even crying while typing this. I badly wanted to get out of this hell. Is there any WFH job available here that you can suggest? I am eager to learn anything. Even if it's not related with my profession, I am fine with it.

What kind of WFH allowances does your employer have for its employees? What are your thoughts on what they should be? (Cross-Posted),"Cross-Posted to r/nonprofit

In an increasingly digital world, there are more and more employers becoming fully remote. Being asked to work remote requires you to have an appropriate home office setup (computer, desk, internet, etc).

I am reviewing the current home office support policy for our organization, located in Canada, and am interested in what different organizations offer. Main points of interest:

* Are your allowances taxable or nontaxable?
* Are they reimbursed (ie you submit receipts and are reimbursed up to a certain amount), or do you regularly receive your allowance throughout the year and no requirement for receipts (for example, $100 annually paid out biweekly in your paystub)?
* If you don't mind sharing, what amounts are your allowances? Do you think they are sufficient?
* Do you receive one lump sum, or are there different amounts designated for different types of allowances (computer equipment, furniture, internet, etc)?
* On the accounting side of things, when an employee is reimbursed for a computer, it generally has to be amortized over a certain period of time. What are you policies for this? How do you track this and what is done if an employee leaves before it has been fully amortized?

I find the government regulations for these types of allowances are not always clear and would greatly appreciate any resources for setting amounts and processes.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",love_and_porkchops,1732311499.0,2,remotework
My experience with WFH and making $30/hr,"I went from working as an RN to needing something to pay the bills as I took a mental break. I found a few things not very steady at all, maybe $10 here, $20 there. Then someone showed me Outlier and I've read all the reviews on it but decided to try it out. I took a day and onboarded for a couple projects(1-2 hours per project) and got accepted into one in October going until just recently. 

I was taking in $600-700 a week doing maybe 4 hours a day which absolutely kept my bills paid, thankfully.

"Hybrid work is not the future, says Meta‚Äôs former director of remote work: It‚Äôs an ‚Äòillusion of choice‚Äô","She gets is 100%



‚ÄúHybrid is an illusion of choice,‚Äù Dean tells Fortune. Mandatory office attendance, which Dean calls ‚Äúthe crux‚Äù of hybrid plans, is more sinister than it looks, and most workers don‚Äôt acknowledge how central they are. By mandating any amount of time in the office, companies remove many potential benefits for the employee ‚Äúand much of the benefit for the company.‚Äù

(...)

On the other hand, enforcing even just one day in-person per week ‚Äúrequires people to organize their life around the office, and companies have to pay the highest cost of real estate,‚Äù Dean says. ‚ÄúIt means you‚Äôre carrying all the costs of the old model, and can‚Äôt have any efficiencies of the new model.‚Äù

(...)

Plus, she adds, the office is never going to be a solution to existing problems of productivity, innovation, or creativity. ‚ÄúThose are all how to work problems, not where to work problems,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe office won‚Äôt solve these problems. New ways of working will. This is a watershed moment of innovation of how work gets done, but we‚Äôre still talking about the f‚Äìking watercooler.‚Äù",Accomplished-Wave356,1699189817.0,666,remotework
The hidden cost of hybrid and in-person work: why fully remote is a game changer,"This is going to be a fun read, I promise. üçø

Let‚Äôs talk about what I call the ‚Äútelenovela principle‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a cognitive scientist, and these ideas come purely from observation and experience. But if you‚Äôve ever been caught up in a telenovela or a long-running series, you‚Äôll know the feeling: the intricate power plays, the unspoken hierarchies, the rituals of dominance, and the subtle tensions that keep the drama alive. Even if you step away for a while, the moment you return, you‚Äôre right back in it, and you are *part* of it, immediately recalling the dynamics, decoding glances, and anticipating the next twist.

The office works the same way. When you‚Äôre in person, even part-time, you‚Äôre a participant in this ongoing story. There‚Äôs always a ‚Äúbig monkey‚Äù asserting dominance, the boss who commands unspoken rituals of loyalty, like requiring everyone to laugh at their jokes or adjust their tone in their presence. There are the everyday performers, like the colleague who thrives on adoration or the gatekeeper who silently enforces invisible rules. These aren‚Äôt written in any handbook, but they exist, and they require your mental energy to navigate. You find yourself noticing the power struggles, the alliances forming in hushed conversations, and the subtle gestures signaling favor or disapproval. It‚Äôs an endless stream of social processing, often unrelated to the actual work.

Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt escape this dynamic. Each time you enter the office, it‚Äôs like pressing play on a paused series. You have to catch up on the latest storylines: who‚Äôs climbing the ladder, who‚Äôs fallen out of favor, what new rituals or hierarchies have taken shape. The telenovela is still there, waiting for you, demanding the same mental energy to re-engage with the social mechanics. Hybrid work doesn‚Äôt simplify the drama at all; it just makes it episodic, reinforcing the need to tune back into the plot every time you return.

Fully remote work eliminates this layer of complexity. The drama loses its stage when everyone is behind a screen. Without the proximity to assert dominance or build unspoken hierarchies, the focus shifts to what truly matters: the work itself. While remote collaboration still involves interaction, it‚Äôs more task-oriented and far less emotionally draining. It spares you from the subtle politics, the rituals of adoration, and the constant recalibration that in-person work demands. The absence of this unnecessary ‚Äústory‚Äù frees up your mental space, allowing you to focus on your creativity, productivity, and actual goals. It‚Äôs no wonder that some ‚Äúbig personalities‚Äù resist remote work: it removes the tools they depend on to thrive in this unspoken telenovela. 
Remote work frees us to skip the BS, so to let the big personalities cling to their shenanigans, leaving the drama to the TV.",RevolutionStill4284,1736178369.0,998,remotework
Executives and Research Disagree About Hybrid Work. Why? (New York Times),"**Executives and Research Disagree About Hybrid Work. Why?**

*Companies like Amazon have required a return to the office five days a week despite findings showing benefits to employers that allow some remote days.*

Amazon‚Äôs C.E.O., Andy Jassy, made waves last month when he demanded that all employees return to the office five days a week. The proclamation seemed to validate similar demands made by executives like JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs‚Äôs David Solomon. And it naturally raised the question of whether others might follow suit. (It appears some have.)

But it also flew in the face of researchers and their studies that have found hybrid work benefits companies. Stanford‚Äôs Nick Bloom, for example, has found that employees who work two days a week at home are just as productive and less likely to quit. (Bloom, like others, speculated that Amazon‚Äôs pronouncement was really an attempt to reduce the work force without official layoffs.)

So why do so many employers that say they‚Äôre data-driven seem to move counter to science?

Executives are not convinced by the research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like: ‚ÄòAspirin definitely helps with headaches. It‚Äôs been proven again and again and again,‚Äô‚Äù Laszlo Bock, a former senior vice president for people operations at Google, told DealBook. ‚ÄúThe academic studies that have been done, and there are not that many, show a range of outcomes ‚Äî and they generally show a kind of neutral to slightly positive.‚Äù

Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton, said he disagreed, pointing DealBook to a meta-analysis of 108 studies.

Some are just over it. Almost five years since the start of the pandemic, many C.E.O.s are ready to move on from an experiment they never wanted to start. ‚ÄúWhen we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,‚Äù Jassy wrote in a memo about ending remote work at Amazon.

Grant says C.E.O.s may not always methodically control for whether an effect was caused by remote work, the pandemic or something else, as an academic researcher would.

They also may not want to find out that hybrid work is better.

‚ÄúLeadership is a lot less fulfilling and a lot less fun when you‚Äôre doing it remotely,‚Äù Bock said.

They see their company as different. Many of the executives who have called employees back to the office point to the particularities of their business or industry that require in-person work.

That includes Jassy. ‚ÄúOur culture is unique,‚Äù he wrote in the memo.

This predisposition to dismiss outside data is common. ‚ÄúWhen we replicated studies in different industries, in different organizations, the patterns look pretty similar,‚Äù Grant said. ‚ÄúAnd when I talk to C.E.O.s, they all have the same struggles and challenges regardless of an industry.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not practical. Hybrid work may be technically the best route, but it‚Äôs also complicated to oversee. Time is money, and C.E.O.s may not want to spend theirs deliberating over a decision about bringing workers back ‚Äî or figuring out how to manage a hybrid workplace.

But that, Grant argues, may be missing the point.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a premium on decisiveness in the business world,‚Äù he said. But ‚Äúif you‚Äôre making a highly consequential, irreversible decision, you are supposed to slow down as much as possible.‚Äù",IMSLI,1728744343.0,459,remotework

Recently, the CEO announced a mandatory 4-day in office work week for hybrid employees. Initially, I didn‚Äôt think this applied to me, but then I found out that I now have to come in 3 days a week.

RTO is a f*cking joke,"I don't buy that 5 day RTO will improve collaboration or any performance metrics. In fact I expect productivity to get worse. Here's why:

*Increased commute*

This one is probably the most obvious, but with thr average commute times being around 30 mins, that's an extra hour of your day gone. It's hard to give your best when you're 1) tired from commuting 2) feeling worn down because you have less time in the day to attend to personal life

That's not even considering the extra fuel needed to commute more, putting more financial pressure on employees in an already difficult economy

*Familiarity breeds contempt*

I've worked fully remote, fully in office and hybrid. In my opinion, hybrid is the sweet spot where you continue to manage social relationships with your coworkers which is very useful for productivity. However, seeing/having lunch with your coworkers after a few days a week gets old and annoying. More time spent together also means more chances to get tired of the little annoying things they might do. Like a dripping faucet. Hybrid allowed a nice reset so I felt ready for interaction again

*More hassle*

Prompting everyone to return means more struggle to find parking, more traffic, more accidents (I've seen an unreal amount of them the past couple weeks). 

Meal prepping for the entire week lest you have to eat out and spend unnecessary money. I know this is what they want, but it's frustrating nonetheless


*Less privacy/deep thought*

In office is okay when trying to purely execute on a task from muscle memory but for those who require quiet for deep concentration, it's not the place, especially for an open floorplan office. 

Additionally, coworkers will sometimes interrupt when you're in a flow state which really hurts overall productivity

When I worked fully remotely, I ended up getting promoted off of working 5-6 hour days because I was so much more productive working at home alone. 

*Additional factors*

More likely to get sick. It's winter and everyone is sick. They advise to stay home when sick but I honestly think it'd a badge of honor/dedication in the US to show up even when sick...I don't get it

*Worse for the environment*

It's the in thing for companies to claim they're sustainable or going green these days, but unecessarily forcing people to commute in more often completely opposes that. 

*Meetings are a huge waste of time*

There is this culture of forced delinquency in meetings where you may or may not be needed, but you may sit in a 90 min meeting and only spent 5 mins talking. That time could be used for mindless tasks like packing the dishwasher or folding clothes while still listening and contributing when necessary 

All in all, 5 day RTO seems completely unnecessary for people who can do their jobs remotely and it's infuriating to be micromanaged like this as an adult. As long as my semi annual reviews are good, who cares how often I'm in the office?

Hybrid Work: Is the glass half empty or half full? ,"My company‚Äôs hybrid policy requires all employees to work in the office one designated week per month, on a rotation. This would be fine, except:

1. **The work is identical regardless of location.**
   * Whether I‚Äôm at home or in the office, my job involves logging into the same system, attending virtual meetings, and completing tasks that could be done from anywhere.
2. **There‚Äôs no in-person collaboration or site-specific work.**
   * My team is spread across multiple locations, so any collaboration happens online via Zoom and Microsoft Teams, whether I‚Äôm at home or sitting in a cubicle.
3. **PTO usage during office weeks must be ‚Äúmade up.‚Äù**
   * If I take PTO for a day during my in-office week (even for unavoidable life events), I have to make up that office day during my next rotation.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: this policy makes no sense. The only difference between my in-office and remote workdays is that I spend an hour driving to perform the exact same tasks. There‚Äôs no reason for us to be in the office other than to comply with the rotation. It‚Äôs office work for the sake of office work.

Plus, this requirement to make up office days feels punitive. Life happens. People get sick, need personal time, or face emergencies. Forcing employees to make up those days discourages taking PTO during in-office weeks, which seems like the real intention of this policy.",Due_Bullfrog_8132,1732148120.0,32,remotework
Small % of team abusing hybrid work - jeopardizing the arrangement for the rest of us.    ,"Not trying to cause any drama/controversy here - but wanted to get some thoughts.   

I am a SDE (principle level) at bigtech.   Our division mgmt for a variety of historic (and where people are based) reasons has been slow at pushing for RTO - unlike some of the thinking elsewhere in the company.   We can generally come in once or maybe twice a week - for important design reviews, working with junior SDEs etc.   It has been wonderful to be able to work from home for most of the week.   

Issue.   A small % of engineers (say <15% of senior and principal levels) are <seemingly> abusing hybrid - by always seeming to have excuses why they are missing deadlines, and not helping out junior workers.   A bunch of more senior mgmt folks understand that things happen once in a while- but this has been persistent for months.   Privately, a few have let on that they feel it is not ok for the division to continue this way.   

The issue is that our 2nd and 3rd line managers will not delve into why everyone is not super productive.   A co-worker has been privately told that they will just fall in with the direction other divisions and actively RTO if the situation does not improve.   

What has worked with others - does a group of more experience SDS start speaking up?   Do we not cover for folks missing deadlines.

One Company A/B Tested Hybrid Work. Here‚Äôs What They Found.,,work_hau_ab,1730827056.0,64,remotework
Hybrid work advice ,"Looking for advice for an upcoming 1:1 meeting with our regional manager. This meeting is due to ongoing complaints about our local manager and is basically our chance to bring up concerns. 

My primary concern is work schedule .
Background: company is hybrid, 3 days in office 2 days WFH. This is referred to in job posting as a benefit /perk and was highlighted as a perk again during interviews and in negotiations. 

Fast forward to starting job: 
My team are all hourly as we work non standard hours often doing evening and weekend work which requires flexible schedules. 
However, our manager recommends we do events on weekends or our WFH days . And I‚Äôve even heard other teammates discuss how it‚Äôs really like we are not hybrid bc many of our WFH days are spent at events.

My frustration point is the mandatory 3 days in office is strict and I feel they are trying to force us into the mold of the standard office employee with a set schedule. However, we are many times spending our Sundays at events and then stuck going into office the next day bc it‚Äôs a mandatory office day. (Yes I know this is a first world problem) but I took a big pay cut in lieu of hybrid schedule so it‚Äôs frustrating . 

In my 1:1 I would love to bring this up but I want to do so tactfully as I am still relatively new. But I do feel now is a good time bc there is ongoing issues on our team that they want to remediate.

So my ask is how would you approach this, what verbiage would you use , how can I frame this to be constructive instead of just whiny.

"I was hired as a fully remote employee but now they are asking me to switch to hybrid after 3 months, what can I do to push back?","The TLDR is the title but further details below.

The Context:
So their recruiter reached out to me and throughout the interview process (5 rounds) I made it clear that I was only looking to be fully remote and not hybrid. My offer letter/contract states that my position is fully-remote with 10% travel as needed (with expenses covered when traveling for work) and I have confirmation (in writing) that if I were to be reassigned projects I would be able to retain 100% fully-remote status. 
Also, I was hired at the top most range of the salary offering because they seemed to really want me on their team.

The Conundrum:
3 months in as a fully-remote employee I have gotten nothing but stellar remarks on my work, everything is always accurate and completed on time. 
But they are now asking for the whole team to switch to hybrid work; wanting at least 3 days on-site/wk. This was hinted at during the past three months but I always felt exempt from this requirement given what I have in writing. The calls for hybrid work are becoming more and more serious but I haven't been explicitly told by the boss that I have to fall in line with the requirement, however a special meeting has been scheduled to talk on this subject next week!
The thing is my commute would be untenable (3-4 hours one way!) so I would have to relocate to a much higher cost-of-living county to avoid 24 hours of commute time/week. I enjoy the work and the team dynamics and getting paid the highest salary of my career thus far ain't too shabby either so I'd like to retain the job but....

The question(s):
If I have to relocate, even though I was hired at the highest level of the salary offering, is there room to negotiate a base-salary raise for switching to hybrid?

Is it reasonable to ask for my moving expenses to be covered?

I much prefer this role as fully remote and don't see the value in being on site, how could I make a case that I can continue performing well fully remote?

I am tempted to reaffirm my aversion to hybrid work and let them decide if they want to keep me but re-entering the job market is a daunting challenge i'd rather want to avoid. 

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading. ",spenchlish42,1728071470.0,441,remotework

They also brush aside clear evidence that remote work gets the job done, trotting out tired excuses about ‚Äúculture‚Äù while pushing policies that go against their own green goals by shoving people back into long commutes. Add in the fact that employees are stuck footing the bill for gas, transit, or whatever else comes with being back in the office, and it‚Äôs clear these mandates are not about teamwork but control and real estate.

Request to Relocate Denied,"Hello, I‚Äôve been working for a company my entire adult life, for the last 17/18 years in the same roll which I kind of don‚Äôt hate.

But suddenly they‚Äôve decided we‚Äôre not allowed to do that. How is it ok for them for force us into an office after 15 years and start suddenly denying requests to relocate?

"As of 2024, 12.7% of full-time employees in India work from home, while 28.2% work a hybrid model.","based on this article- https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/business/remote-work-statistics/

Currently, 12.7% of full-time employees work from home, illustrating the rapid normalization of remote work environments. Simultaneously, 28.2% of employees have adapted to a hybrid work model. This model combines home and in-office working, offering flexibility and maintaining a physical presence at the workplace .

Despite the steady rise in remote work, most of the workforce (59.1%) still works in the office. This percentage underscores that while remote work is on the upswing, traditional in-office work is far from obsolete. 

By 2025, 60 to 90 million Indians will work remotely by 2025
Looking ahead, the future of remote work seems promising. According to CXOToday, by 2025, an estimated 60 to 90 million Indians will be working remotely, which equates to approximately 10.12% to 15.17% of the Indian workforce, when India‚Äôs labor force is 593 million, according to World Bank Data. This projection suggests a continuous, yet gradual, shift towards remote work arrangements.

98% of workers want to work remotely at least some of the time. 
Interestingly, workers‚Äô preference for remote work aligns with this trend. A staggering 98% of workers expressed the desire to work remotely, at least part of the time.

"Hybrid Work Policy - Office Time Make-Up for PTO?
","I work a hybrid job where I‚Äôm expected to be in the office one week per month and work remotely the other three weeks.

Hybrid Work Dilemma ,"Hey everybody,

I‚Äôm currently in a hybrid job where I work three weeks remote and one week on-site each month. There‚Äôs no real difference in the work I do remotely vs. in the office‚Äîno conferences, no team collaborations, no special projects requiring my physical presence. It honestly feels like the higher-ups mandate office time just to justify the real estate. But it is what it is. The job itself is low stress, not mentally taxing, and the pay is decent.

The issue is, I live in a high COL area and commute 40 miles each way to the office during my on-site week. With urban commuter traffic, the drive takes me 1 to 1.5 hours in the morning and at least 1.5 hours coming back. We‚Äôre renting, and it‚Äôs getting cramped where we currently live. I‚Äôm on a month-to-month lease, which I can leave with a 60-day notice, but upgrading to a place with more space (like an extra bedroom) closer to the office isn‚Äôt feasible on my salary.

One option is to relocate to a small town about 57 miles in the opposite direction. The town has everything we need and is within our budget. Conveniently, my company has another office near that second location, and I can easily transfer. That would cut my commute to driving 27 miles each way, and this new location doesn‚Äôt have the metropolitan traffic like the current one.

Another option is to stay where we are for now, then move closer to the original office when my spouse starts working again (she has a graduate degree in information systems management), which would give us the extra income to afford something closer.

We don‚Äôt have family ties here, just close friends, but moving an hour and a half away means we won‚Äôt see them as often.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any advice? Would love to hear your thoughts!",Moscowmule21,1727272719.0,2,remotework

RTO and the Pandemic,"This is my organization‚Äôs first winter in the office since covid started and it‚Äôs so obvious to me that this is backfiring. Junior employees are all in open offices with 30-60 people and people with their own offices (supervisors) regularly hang out in the open office space. We don‚Äôt get enough sick days so people come in when sick, and even though managers get way more PTO many keep coming in while visibly ill (not masking of course), I guess to prove that if they can we should too? 

People are getting covid, the flu, norovirus, ending up with pneumonia. And it‚Äôs so obvious that a lot of people are dealing with new health issues from past covid infections without being willing to connect the dots. We had a bump in sickness when kids returned to school in the fall but this is next level

I was ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù before the pandemic (before we called it that, I did a lot of work in the community but got to flexibly work from home when I wanted) and all through out. I joined this organization in the summer right after they RTOed from one to four days a week. I also noticed that people who didn‚Äôt have to work in person during the first few waves of the pandemic seem less likely to take off or even mask when sick‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly repulsive especially since I work at a health care organization now

We get more sick days starting 1/1 but no way people are going to make it through the winter Covid waves/flu/RSV/norovirus without using a lot of them. If avian flu goes human to human we‚Äôre so fucked. Some of my friends whose jobs RTOed earlier on got unlimited sick days or way more (like 30, 60, even more days), but some of us still have 5 (we have 12 but that‚Äôs only one day a month!)

It‚Äôs unclear to me what the plan is‚Äîwe were told over the summer that people need to stop taking so many sick days unplanned (lmao). I guess senior employees who get hit bad will retire early? And junior employees will just get so sick we can‚Äôt work anymore? It makes no sense and it makes me wonder what‚Äôs going to happen when all the big companies returning to 5 days in office experience this same thing

I‚Äôm hoping to leave before winter illnesses get too bad in this office but just in the time between Christmas and NYE I had a coworker go to the hospital with pneumonia‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt sustainable and it makes no sense that companies would sacrifice the workforce to illness like this‚Äîit‚Äôs estimated the global economy is losing $1 trillion (1% of the GDP) a year already due to Long Covid, why do they want the number to grow??",Dis-Organizer,1735690321.0,431,remotework

Hybrid Work = Result of the Machiavelli Effect,"I am reading ‚ÄúWhere Is My Flying Car‚Äù by J. Storrs Hall and have reached Chapter 6: The Machiavelli Effect. The parallels to my work life as so uncanny. 

Hall essentially defines the term as the suboptimal outcome achieved by two conditions:
1. A rejection of the new by ‚Äúthe Nobles‚Äù, the class that has benefited from the old way
2. An inability to mobilize for a revolution by ‚Äúthe Traders‚Äù, those who would stand to benefit but are at risk as individuals if they were to defect against the old way

I currently work for a tech company that is debating whether to go remote, stay hybrid, or return to mandatory in-office policy circa 2019. Interestingly the people in power (e.g., executives and rising extroverts) want to maximize in-office time since it directly benefits them. 

A property of the Machiavelli effect is that the Nobles ostensibly want to keep the policy for admirable reasons, but in reality it is for selfish ones. In this case, it is clear that extroverts benefit from in-office schmoozing, while they point to unfalsifiable benefits such as ‚Äúculture‚Äù as a reason to force everyone to the office. 

For a Trader to speak out against the policy, they put themselves at risk. So, in the end, we will likely end up at a suboptimal ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù outcome with 1-2 mandatory days, when in reality the full flexible model would have benefitted the most people.

Went from remote to hybrid‚Ä¶ how exhausting,"Since before COVID, I remember how exhausted I used to be in my 20s going to the office. I used to think it was because of my commute which was 40 minutes with no traffic, but usually about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. 

But then I went remote and felt like I got so much of my life back. In 2025, we went hybrid again and now I go in 3 days a week. I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal because now I live about five minutes away from the office.

But was I in for a surprise. I come home from work at around four and go in at like 830. This is a pretty cool schedule for the most part but I still find myself burnt out barely able to move as soon as I get home, not even able to think 

The ironic part is this is the easiest job I‚Äôve ever had. I don‚Äôt feel any pressure for management. Everyone seems really cool but something about going in is just soul crushing.

Does anyone have any tips? What could it be? I didn‚Äôt go in dreading the situation and even now I just think well it is what it is so I don‚Äôt imagine that this is psychological. I sit at a desk all day so it‚Äôs not physical. I get a good amount of sleep and I eat properly and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what is causing the exhaustion .",Adventurous-Cash2044,1739500141.0,353,remotework

I feel like I do way more work as a remote worker than I did when I worked in the office.,"What I initially loved about remote work was the option to do household chores throughout the day. After I finished a task, I could do my laundry, I could walk the dog, I could do some cleaning, I could take a shower, you get it. In the office, I worked about the same amount of hours, but in my downtime, I was forced to sit and look busy or shoot the breeze with coworkers instead of actually being productive.

I moved from hybrid to work from home about a month ago. If I am away from my computer for more than two minutes, I am logged off. My boss is tracking how often my computer is logged off and for how long. I have two different productivity trackers installed, that track the amount of time it takes for me to be assigned a task versus viewing the task versus finishing the task. It‚Äôs insane.

Being tracked to this level, actually makes me less productive! I work in short bursts, not in one steady stream. I need a little breaks to work on different types of tasks or talk to people in order to keep my energy up. I‚Äôm not a fucking robot. Again, in the office, I wouldn‚Äôt be penalized for that.

* 3 conference rooms \[no noise-canceling booths\] for 65 employees who do most of their work with people outside the office (teams on other hybrid shift).

* No natural light.
* I'm pretty sure desks and chairs aren't designed for full-time use. I end up getting back-pain.

REAL Reasons CEOs Want Workers Back in the Office,"Why are many organizations pushing for a return to office, especially when most have seen success with remote employees?

From what I‚Äôve seen and the data, the real truth comes down to these five: 

1. Money spent on commercial real estate. 

2. To mask upcoming layoffs and downsizing.

3. To regain and maintain corporate control. 

4. Do not feel comfortable managing remotely. 

5. It‚Äôs actually just their work preference. 


Look, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to work in the office, whether hybrid or fully five days a week. Everyone has a preference and we have options of where to work. 

But the push back from remote workers is because executives are pulling back on empty promises from going remote. Or just straight lying about the real reasons.

Is remote & hybrid work the new normal?,"Forbes recently shared an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carabrennanallamano/2023/07/18/demystifying-hybrid--remote-work-what-were-still-getting-wrong-about-our-new-normal/) on the future of remote and hybrid work policies. This topic relates to our future if remote is to be a part of it.

**What is the context?**

As we approach 3 years from the onset of the pandemic, remote and hybrid work are becoming the ""new normal"" for many employees. A recent Stanford study found that teleworking (remote work) accounts for over a quarter of paid full-time workdays in the US. 

Q Hamirani, the mastermind behind Airbnb's Digital Nomad program, shares his experiences and lessons from transitioning to remote work during the pandemic.

&#x200B;

* **Workforce Flexibility and Talent Acquisition:** Remote and hybrid work policies allow employees to choose where they work, improving their work-life balance and greater job satisfaction. This flexibility also attracts a diverse pool of talent.
* **Cultural and Community Building Challenges:** While remote work provides flexibility, it challenges fostering organisational solid culture and building a sense of community among remote teams. Companies must invest in creative ways to maintain connections and collaboration.
* **Organisational Productivity and Performance:** Remote work affects productivity differently across roles and industries. Organisations need practical methods to measure and optimise remote work productivity.

**What Else Can We Learn?** 

The key takeaway from Hamirani is that remote and hybrid work will become increasingly important. Flexibility and adapting policies to an organisation's unique culture and business model are critical to success. For a deeper understanding of how to thrive in a diverse work environment, including remote work, consider [expanding your cultural skills](https://www.paularnesen.com/culturally-fluent-newsletter). In my experience, this is critical for remote work, promoting effective communication, collaboration and inclusion between diverse teams working in different cultures.",workingwithus,1690291036.0,0,remotework

Is RTO really making sense? IMO remote work seems way more logical in the long run.,"Been seeing a lot of RTO talk lately, and honestly? I'm not buying the logic behind it. Feels like companies are just pointing fingers at remote work whenever something goes wrong, without really thinking it through. I've worked at fully remote and hybrid companies for years, and depending on the work, I got way more done remotely than I ever did with mandatory office time.

Look, I'm not saying every job should be remote - that'd be crazy. But this whole company-wide RTO thing? Kinda feels like it's just exec ego trips, you know? Something about it just doesn't sit right with me.

What do y'all think? Personally, I vibe more with leaders who can think flexibly about this stuff. Pretty sure those are the companies that'll crush it in the long run.

Would you leave a remote job to go onsite/hybrid?,"I currently work fully remote at FinTech company and make about $60K a year. Great benefits and unlimited PTO (which I definitely enjoy). The role is niche though and didn‚Äôt require any experience when I applied because they were willing train people that had at least a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. 

However, I want to leave the job because it doesn‚Äôt align with my career goals (data analyst). And I honestly hate the role. The main issue with job hunting is how competitive remote roles are.

Is that not taking away your hybrid working rights purely on the basis of you taking annual leave? Almost feels like a punishment!

When do you think remote work will become the standard practice across the corporate world?,"When do you anticipate that remote work will become the standard practice across the corporate world? Remote work has always been a concept, but its widespread adoption seemed to gain momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, about two years after its initial surge, many companies began reintroducing in-office work. My company is one of those that initially transitioned to remote work and has now moved to a hybrid model. Unfortunately, it also appears they are gradually attempting to shift back to a five-day in-office workweek, which seems to be of particular interest to the boomer high ups.

Most RTO mandates are likely going away by 2028,"Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexanderpuutio/2024/04/25/why-most-ceos-are-likely-to-overturn-their-rto-mandates-by-2028/

TLDR: Most RTO mandates are guided by financial interests rather than employee needs. By 2028, over 500 million sq ft of commercial real estate leases will expire. 
Once leases expire, CFOs will prioritize reducing overhead costs over RTO. Consequently, most RTO mandates will be overturned once financial obligations are removed. 
Forced RTO does not work and hurts employee performance and satisfaction, as engagement is lowest for on-site employees, signaling a need for autonomy. 
Younger generations strongly prefer flexibility and remote/hybrid options, and flexible/remote work models are proving more effective and improve engagement. 
As a result, no-office/remote-first companies will become more common after 2028, and the future of work will focus more on choice, motivation, and unique experiences.",RevolutionStill4284,1716434523.0,315,remotework

Are full RTO mandates making hybrid roles look unreliable to potential hires?,"If even just a few hybrid companies (such as Amazon) start imposing full RTO, they could inadvertently signal that ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù isn‚Äôt a stable or guaranteed arrangement, making candidates wary. Even when a position is marketed as hybrid, candidates might now see it as temporary or a stepping stone back to full on-site work, especially in organizations where leadership has shown a willingness to revoke hybrid policies.
This approach could create a sense of instability and lack of trust in the company‚Äôs flexibility promises. Candidates seeking consistency in work location would likely feel hesitant, as they may worry that a so-called ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù job could unexpectedly require them to be on-site full-time.

# Hybrid work

&#x200B;

**What's wrong?**

* Most organizations were forced to **switch to remote work mode almost overnight** during the pandemic. There was no time to build a proper culture or a foundation for new ways of working.
* That led to many **inefficiencies**. [**Death by Zoom**](https://paulitaylor.com/2020/05/08/death-by-zoom-have-we-failed-the-mass-home-working-experiment/) is a thing. Distractions are worse than in-office. Many are **lonely**, and don't know when to **finish working** leading to **burnouts**.
* With vaccines on the [**way**](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/02/uk/uk-pfizer-vaccine-approval-gbr-intl/index.html), we are facing the **possibility of returning to offices**. But most people don't want the pure corporate office experience anymore. They want the **best of both worlds.**

&#x200B;

**How to fix it?**

* It's time to take a **step back** and return to the drawing board. We need to **re-think** both remote and in-office work.
* **Taking laptops home is not enough.** Building a real **hybrid work** culture takes time and effort.

&#x200B;

**How can companies improve?**

* [**Most people**](https://slack.com/intl/en-fi/blog/collaboration/workplace-transformation-in-the-wake-of-covid-19) prefer a **hybrid work arrangement** that combines home and office.
* **Start building hybrid (or decentralized) work into your organization's DNA.** Craft a foundation that enables productive work from anywhere, keeps people engaged and provides them flexibility at the same time.
* Treat decentralization **as a tool** to achieve your overall goals. Mark W. Johnson and Josh Suskewicz propose a [**4-step future-back approach**](https://hbr.org/2020/07/does-your-company-have-a-long-term-plan-for-remote-work). Start from your **end vision** and work your way back to the start. This allows you to see things from a **fresh perspective.**
* Pick the low-hanging fruit when it comes to [**cost savings**](https://www.business.com/articles/working-from-home-save-money/). Embrace the opportunity to **reduce office footprint** and **keep business travel at minimum** also after the pandemic. [**Research suggests**](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics) you could save an **average of $11,000** per half-time remote worker per year.
* Instead of huge central offices, provide access to **smaller, safe and flexible satellite offices** to enable on-site work when and where needed. See [**Workmode**](https://getinworkmode.com/), [**UMA Workspace**](https://umaworkspace.com/) and [**Mothership of Work**](https://mow.fi/en/).
* Transform office time into a platform of [**collaboration, socialisation and sharing ideas.**](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/12/my-company-has-gone-fully-remote-and-im-despairing-who-wins-in-the-new-world-of-working-from-home)

**How about the future?**

* Companies developing a seamless decentralized company culture will tap into the **global talent pool**. Why work with the best living around your offices when you can work with **the best in the country? Or the best in the world?**
* Hybrid work, Covid and increasing expenses in big cities will incentivize people to move into [**smaller local communities**](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/post-covid-19-world-will-less-global-less-urban/). Or to other [**countries**](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/agencies_explore_idea_of_finland_as_remote_working_paradise/11554324). Work will be **even less location dependent.**
* Countries are increasingly launching remote-friendly [**visa programs**](https://www.insider.com/countries-welcoming-remote-workers-live-and-work-2020-7#hawaiis-movers-and-shakas-program-asks-participants-to-help-a-local-nonprofit-1). Physical locations and jobs are increasingly **uncoupling.**
* Technology will be an [**enabler**](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/12/my-company-has-gone-fully-remote-and-im-despairing-who-wins-in-the-new-world-of-working-from-home), not an answer. Tools will not take care for the **wellbeing** of your people. And your **people** are the ones providing results.
* **Well-planned and managed cybersecurity** will become even more crucial than before. The **number of devices** is exploding, transfer to cloud is accelerating. There will be a **bigger surface area** for attackers to target on. Take care of this **now**. Or [**suffer**](https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/vastaamo_board_fires_ceo_says_he_kept_data_breach_secret_for_year_and_a_half/11614603) from the [**consequences.**](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement)

**Case examples**

* [**Trello**](https://trello.com/en/pdf/hybrid-work-guide.pdf) has built a hybrid work culture. They believe in iteration, proactivity, empathy and trust. Trello advices to build a **hybrid blueprint first.**
* [**Hubspot**](https://www.hubspot.com/careers-blog/future-of-work-hybrid) was ""remote-ish"" in the past. Their new hybrid vision allows people to choose from **3 options: office, flex or home**. Everyone is allowed to change their working model once per year.
* [**Dropbox**](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first) is going **remote-first**. But they are very much promoting in-person collaboration and community-building. Dropbox also embraces **results over hours** and uses **a toolkit** to land those results.
* [**Shopify**](https://www.shopify.com/careers/work-anywhere) went **digital by default**. Employees are allowed to work up to 90 days per year **wherever they want in the world.**
* [**GitLab**](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/) (among some others) is making the case for going fully remote instead of a hybrid model. They see that a hybrid way of working could lead into **restricted access to information, managing guilt and demands for over performance**. But there are no absolutes. Decide what's right and wrong for your organization. **""Learn, test, iterate and see what works""**

&#x200B;

**Are there business opportunities in all of this?**

* Remote work drives some people crazy. Open concept offices can be a health risk. **Office pods** solve that problem. See [**Framery**](https://www.frameryacoustics.com/en/), [**Into**](https://intoconcept.com/), [**Urban Office**](https://www.urban-office.com/), [**Hush Office**](https://hushoffice.com/en/), [**myofficepod**](https://myofficepod.co.uk/), [**Vetro Space.**](https://vetrospace.com/)
* Turn buildings into a swarm of [**mini-offices**](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/13/office-pods-may-be-the-answer-to-working-safely-post-covid-19). Consider offering them **on-demand**, instead of continuous memberships. Situations change, **flexibility** is key.
* Offer quality [**WFH kits**](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/work-from-home-starter-kit/) as an easy solution for the under equipped home offices. **Ergonomy and employee health** will stay important. Proper tools are a requirement for **productive work.**
* [**Remote rewards**](https://www.trendhunter.com/protrends/wfh-perks) should be a no-brainer for organizations seeking to boost the morale and spirit when working at remote locations.
* **Testing job candidates** diligently but fast becomes even more important when they are working half or fully remotely. This requires new kinds of recruiting services. See [**Codility.**](https://www.codility.com/)

&#x200B;

**What are the challenges?**

* Hybrid work models might divide **employees into two levels**. In-office people might get access to more information than their remote counterparts. **Ensure that information flows** freely regardless of location.
* Everyone [**reacts differently**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/j0u6gg/how_are_you_doing_mentally_with_full_time_remote/) to the new circumstances. Some people are better off, some worse.
* Uncoupling of jobs and location can also lead to **wage levels flattening out** across the globe. There's a tendency already to [**pay less**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/permanent-remote-work-may-also-mean-a-pay-cut/) for remote workers outside high-cost areas. In the distant future, this could lead to **similar wages everywhere.**

**Key takeaways**

* **Switching to hybrid work** offers many advantages. Employees get increased flexibility. Companies can reduce their physical footprint. Hiring the best talent is no longer restricted to physical locations.
* However, the change **will not happen overnight**. Buy in to small changes first, see what works and what doesn't. Build a proper foundation for hybrid work to succeed.
* Big tech. companies are already **paving the way**. Trello, Hubspot, Dropbox, Shopify and Coinbase are switching to hybrid work systems. **The trendsetters are largely going ""remote-first""** with possibilities for weekly in-office working.
